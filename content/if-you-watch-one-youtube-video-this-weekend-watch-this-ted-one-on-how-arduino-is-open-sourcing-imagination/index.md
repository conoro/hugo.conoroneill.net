#"If you watch one YouTube video this weekend, watch this TED one on how Arduino is open-sourcing imagination"

Massimo Banzi is one of the creators of <a href="http://arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, an Open Source hardware platform that is used everywhere from robot kits for kids to the Large Hadron Collider.

If you are, like me, bored senseless with the same old Twitter/Facebook/YaddaYadda, watch this and then watch your imagination take flight.
