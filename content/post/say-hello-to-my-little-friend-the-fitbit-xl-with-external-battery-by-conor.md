My first Fitbit died in the washing machine and they kindly replaced it for free. The replacement's battery started acting up recently and finally gave up the ghost last night. You won't believe what happens next ;-)

I figured out how to take apart the Fitbit One on the original dead one so this time I managed to do it with no damage. I de-soldered the battery and tried the old one instead. No joy. I've found some Chinese suppliers of 55mAh Lipos but I don't have the patience to wait. One slightly too big battery and some hot-glue later and I give you the FitBit One XL.

Now that I know it works, I'll remove most of the hot glue and try some Shoe Goo instead.
