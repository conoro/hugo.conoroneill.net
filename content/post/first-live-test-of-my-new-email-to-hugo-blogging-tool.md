I have almost completed a simple new tool which enables you to send blog  
content via email. The emails are converted to Markdown files and then  
uploaded to my Hugo source repo, along with any inline images.

CircleCI then automatically rebuilds and redeploys my blog to S3.

I'll post full details and source code over the next few days.
