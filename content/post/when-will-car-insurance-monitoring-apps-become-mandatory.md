My Car Insurance Broker, 123.ie just offered me up to 10% off my 2016 premium if I installed a driving monitoring app on my phone.

[No thanks](https://ia801809.us.archive.org/32/items/Orwell1984preywo/orwell1984preywo.pdf)

But when does it go from "get a discount" to "we won't insure you unless you install this app"?
