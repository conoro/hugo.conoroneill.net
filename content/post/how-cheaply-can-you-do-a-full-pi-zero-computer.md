When the incredible [$5 Pi Zero was launched](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-zero/), the usual suspects were so busy snarking how it wasn't really $5, that they completely missed what an important moment in computer history this is. You know the type. The ones who would have ridiculed Tim Berners-Lee's design for the web. Or would have told Linus in no uncertain terms that he was misguided and that microkernels were the future.

Whilst you can't turn on a #PiZero for $5, you also can't connect to the LAN with your $1500 Macbook Pro without buying an adapter.

So assuming we don't factor in electricity costs, carbon credits and depreciation on your chair, how cheaply can you build a fully functioning Raspberry Pi Zero, living in the UK?

Here's what you need:

* [Pi Zero](http://swag.raspberrypi.org/collections/pi-zero/products/pi-zero) £4 + £3 shipping
* [Powered USB Hub](http://www.ebay.ie/itm/USB-2-0-High-Speed-4-Port-Power-On-Off-Switch-LED-Hub-for-PC-Laptop-Notebook-HC-/281721438658?hash=item4197e801c2:g:T8sAAOSwKrhVe~h~) £1.48
* [USB OTG adapter](http://www.ebay.ie/itm/New-Micro-USB-Male-to-Female-OTG-Cable-Adapter-for-Mobile-Cell-Phone-/301681189117?hash=item463d99a0fd:g:AtgAAOSwu4BVmnrL) £1.10
* [Wifi Adapter](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Mini-2-4G-150Mbps-USB-WiFi-Adapter-802-11-b-g-n-Wi-Fi-Dongle-computer/32349764969.html) - £1.25

* [USB to Power converter](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Hot-2Pcs-USB-2-0-to-DC-3-5mm-Barrel-Connector-Jack-Power-Cable-5v-For/32219412146.html) - 62p
* [SD Card](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/offer-listing/B0162YQEIE) - 16GB Class 10 MicroSD + Adapter - £3.95
* Keyboard and Mouse - Any recycling centre for free. Or if you really can't beg borrow or steal one. [This is](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Modern-Design-Pure-White-Ultra-Thin-Design-2-4GHz-Wireless-Keyboard-Cover-Mouse-Kit-for-Desktop/32325530848.html?ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_3,searchweb201644_1_79_78_77_82_80_62_81,searchweb201560_6) £10.26
* Mini-HDMI cable/adapter - [Cable](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/High-quality-1-5M-1-4-Version-mini-HDMI-male-cable-to-hdmi-cable-for-tablet/1509136887.html?ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_3,searchweb201644_1_79_78_77_82_80_62_81,searchweb201560_6) = £1.30 or [Adapter](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/2pcs-set-HDMI-to-Mini-HDMI-to-Micro-HDMI-Adapter-Male-to-Female-Converter-for-Xbox/2048848371.html?ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_3,searchweb201644_1_79_78_77_82_80_62_81,searchweb201560_6) = 97p

Total: £29.01

Or with obvious re-use/borrowing of stuff: £16.70

In Ireland? Add £1 extra for shipping the Pi Zero. Possibly a bit for the SD card from Amazon. Everything else free P&P from China.

Do you need a screen? Yup. Now walk into the sitting room and see if you can spot one. Well done.

A £29 fully fitted-out computer, that you could build the next global webapp on, remains completely revolutionary. All for around the same price as an Apple Thunderbolt-to-Ethernet adapter :-)
