 <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>THE BEHAVIOUR OF the institutional Catholic church in Ireland and around the world is certainly a stark example of both of these truths. But it is not the only example, even in contemporary Ireland. The Irish Amateur Swimming Association, for example, gave coaches the power to do what they liked to children and then engaged in a process of denial that was, albeit on a much smaller scale, essentially the same as that of the bishops.</p><p>The problem is not swimming, any more than it is Catholicism. It is power.</p></blockquote>
