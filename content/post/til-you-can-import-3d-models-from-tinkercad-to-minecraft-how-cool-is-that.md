We had friends over from the US last weekend and their kids loved my [Printrbot 3D printer](http://printrbot.com/project/simple-makers/). They had learned [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) in school so that's what they used to create things so they could print them out. They are now hounding their parents for a printer. Oops :-) But I noticed a "Download to Minecraft" option in Tinkercad and finally just had a chance to try it out. Wow!

[It's incredibly easy](http://blog.tinkercad.com/2013/08/15/tinkercraft/). Take any model from Tinkercad and pick the Minecraft option. You may have to tweak the sizing when you are doing it seriously. Then install the [MCEdit Minecraft editor](http://www.mcedit.net/downloads.html) and import the file into one of your worlds. Then load up Minecraft and thar she blows.

I totally love the intersection of 3D design, 3D printing and Minecraft - the real and the virtual coming together. The younger kids are gonna be psyched when I show em!
