#"Google VP8 Video and current Phones. What's the story?"


 Quick one on VP8. i&#39;m thrilled Google have done this since the whole MPEG LA thing hanging over h.264 was worryin a lot of people. <p /><div>But.</div><p /><div>A lot of PC video cards and more importantly, smartphones, now have h.264 hardware decoders so they can play the video without melting the main CPU.</div><p /><div> Are those decoders hardwired to the h.264 algorithms or will they also be able to handle VP8?</div><p /><div>If they can&#39;t handle VP8, has Google made an entire generation of Android phonesobsoleteovernight?</div>
