I gave up on Twitter in Nov 2017 due to their complete inaction around  
online abuse, particularly that of women. I setup a Mastodon account at  
that time and didn't use it much initially but ramped up activity recently.

Despite all the articles written recently about how Mastodon is the nice  
anti-Twitter, the sad reality is that asshole behaviour has nothing to do  
with the tech or the tools, it has to do with people being assholes.

And so I watched as the pious asshole mob last week piled on to Wil Wheaton  
shortly after he started using Mastodon regularly. What I saw made me  
realise that the whole concept of Twitter-style sites is completely  
ridiculous in a self-justifying asshole-dominated world. How were we ever  
so naive to think that anyone being able to message anything to anyone else  
publicly online would end well?

Wil's blogpost on it: The world is a terrible place right now, and thatâ€™s  
largely because it is what we make it

His experience of early Twitter was identical to my own. And then the  
assholes arrived, as they always do.

A few months ago I put together a spec and a plan for a friendly social  
network. Then I got some sense and deleted it all.

So that's me done I think. Some blogging, photo sharing and private group  
messaging only for the foreseeable future.
