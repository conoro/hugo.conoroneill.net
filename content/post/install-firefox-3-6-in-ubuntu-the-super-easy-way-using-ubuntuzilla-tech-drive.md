 <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Firefox 3.6 final is released and&nbsp;yet again,&nbsp;most Ubuntu users are not able to upgrade their resident Firefox 3.5 to this latest release. Let's cut the chase. All you need to do is to get the latest version of Ubuntuzilla, a python script which pretty much gets the job done, and you will have you Firefox 3.6 installed and ready to rock.</blockquote>
