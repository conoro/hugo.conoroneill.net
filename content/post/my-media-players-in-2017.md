Our journey with media players started a long time ago. But adding a hardware hack to an original XBOX so it could run XBMC was when things really started working well. We've gone through a bunch of devices since, with the Raspberry Pi being the mainstay since 2012, until its lack of x265, 4K and Netflix meant we had to look elsewhere in 2017.

We started with a Wetek Play 2 which initially impressed. It had all the features listed above for a bit more than 100 Euro. But then the annoyances began. We got a new LG 4K TV and they really didn't get on. A known issue appartently, with no fix. The remote control was also a cheap piece of crap. Netflix originally worked ok but then after an OS upgrade, reverted to the mobile version which is impossible to use with a traditional remote control, even in "mouse mode".

I started looking around again and the general consensus was that the Nvidia Shield was head and shoulders above everything else. It was also double the price of anything else! Eventually I gave in and bought it. Overall it's a fabulous device. Kodi works perfectly. Netflix too, even in HDR mode. It's kept very up to date by Nvidia and I've found no major bugs. The game controller is fantastic but we don't really play games on it. The only flaw, and it's a big one, is the remote control. It's a tiny slim device that looks a lot like an old Apple TV one. When it's working, it's great. But it drives me nuts with it's constant refusal to wake up. It often takes 10 button presses and shakes and taps on the side before it finally comes out of sleep so you can pause the thing you are watching. The fact that every Shield update also comes with a firmware update for the remote tells me that they know they have a problem but they are unable to solve it.

Finally we got a generic Android TV box from Gearbest. It's called the X96 blah and it was the cheapest one on the site. After apply loyalty points I got it for less than 20 dollars. I was very surprised by how small it was and impressed that it had both wifi and ethernet built-in. It has the usual slightly rebranded Kodi which works perfectly. Netflix is only the Mobile SD one due to DRM. But it's perfect for the TV in the teenage daughter's room and streams video perfectly from the media server in my home office.

So there you have it. Three good boxes. Some glitches. If you have the money, get the Shield. And maybe a third party wireless remote control.
