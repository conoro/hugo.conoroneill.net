#"Google using Google+ to up-sell Google Apps"

I saw this in the control panel for one of my Google Apps for Your Domain accounts today.

<a href="https://d2j17b10ywb1i7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/googleapps1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-844" title="googleapps" src="https://d2j17b10ywb1i7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/googleapps1.png" alt="" width="783" height="344" /></a>

The value-add for paid accounts on Google Apps has always been very poor. $50 per user for a few tweaks most people don't need. This could change things, particularly for those who want to use Google+ as a replacement for Yammer.
