        <small>I just had to buy this device to celebrate how much Arduino has done for me since 2012</small>

    <section class="post-content">
      <p>Two things happened in early 2012 that have made the past almost-decade a geeky joy - I discovered the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc">Arduino</a> project and the first Raspberry Pi was released. Since then I&rsquo;ve had a ridiculous amount of fun with both and built a ton of useful and useless projects.</p>
<p>Despite having a Masters degree in Electronics, I&rsquo;ve never worked as a Electronic Engineer and have always lived in the software world. I&rsquo;d often wanted to dabble over the years but everything seemed just too difficult. Then somehow I heard about Arduino and bought my first Starter Kit from <a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/Arduino-Starter-Kit-p-1332.html">Seeedstudio</a> in China. It was a revelation. The ability to quickly wire things together and use a massive array of software libraries to assemble a working project was mind-blowing.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s that original Uno which I still use regularly in projects:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2021/12/uno.jpg" alt="Uno"></p>
<p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve watched as purists have bashed the project for numerous reasons. The clunky IDE, the non-standard spacing, the plethora of different boards, the Processing/Wiring language. What all those people missed was the critical importance of having a de-facto standard and an engaged community. I&rsquo;ve seen exactly the same mistake made about the Rasperry Pi - &ldquo;But board XYZ is much more powerful. Or project ABC is more Open Source. Etc etc.&rdquo;. The reason I almost always use Arduino and Pi is that I know, when I start a project, that I will be able to find the answer to any problem I encounter. And that&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>So I was very excited by <a href="https://blog.arduino.cc/2021/12/09/one-board-to-rule-them-all-history-of-the-arduino-uno/">the announcement</a> of the <a href="https://store.arduino.cc/pages/uno-mini-le">Arduino Uno Mini Limited Edition</a> to celebrate 10 million UNO sales and I immediately ordered one. It arrived yesterday and as a piece of history, it&rsquo;s perfect. I was torn between mounting it in a picture frame and using it for a real project.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2021/12/uno-mini.jpg" alt="Uno Mini"></p>
<p>But after examining it, I realised it will have to go in a picture frame. They decided to keep the same number of connectors as the classic UNO but at only 25% of the size. Which means it&rsquo;s impossible to insert standard &ldquo;dupont&rdquo; cables into the sockets side-by-side. So e.g. it&rsquo;s impossible to use the I2C pins together. If it had come with some sort of breakout cables I&rsquo;d totally understand, but as it is, it&rsquo;s all a bit pointless and gimmicky.</p>
<p>Can we expect to see connectors which break everything out into standard sizes at some point?</p>
<p>When it comes to tiny devices, I&rsquo;m much more impressed by things like Adafruit&rsquo;s <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/adafruit-qt-py-samd21-dev-board-with-stemma-qt">QtPy</a></p>
<p>I was also very disappointed that my box arrived damaged inside (not outside) and one of the connector covers was missing. Not exactly what I was expecting for â‚¬60. Their blogpost says &ldquo;Who knows what an unopened UNO Mini Limited Edition (R@RE! Mint, still in box!) will be worth in the years to come&rdquo;. Not very much in my case.</p>
<p>So all-in-all a bit of a missed opportunity for the project but I&rsquo;m happy to support them, given all the pleasure I&rsquo;ve had with Arduino over the past decade.</p>
