<p>But I also had a strong interest in electronics. I&rsquo;d tried a few times to learn from books in the local library but most of them were still about valves! I got (and still have) &ldquo;20 Simple Electronics Projects for the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum&rdquo; around &lsquo;84/&lsquo;85 but I still struggled.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I still think that way of teaching is wrong. The standard response from lecturers of the time was that if you wanted to do practical hands-on stuff, you should go to DIT, which they looked down their noses at. Or become a technician. Perhaps if they looked at Irish Universities pathetic record at being the source of great engineering innovations/patents/products, they&rsquo;d think again about their sense of superiority. Metrics.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So the fact that the vast majority of UCD Engineers don&rsquo;t end up working in engineering is possibly a good thing. That mindset is invaluable in most walks of life. Unfortunately Irish politics is the one area that could really benefit from it and has almost no engineering presence.</p>
<p>By the time I&rsquo;d finished UCD, I was a software guy through and through. I&rsquo;d learned C in 4th year and did all of my Masters using it. I was far more interested in the software development than any of the mathematical algorithms it was implementing. I never wanted to touch anything to do with electronics again.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In parallel to that, I loved anything to do with the internet and was doing a huge amount of stuff there at home and as a sideline in my real job. I ended up switching to that career-wise with the great Embedded Collapse of 2001-2003 (aka the tech crash). I&rsquo;ve had enormous fun over the past 10 years building Enterprise and non-Enterprise software. There has never been a dull day. In fact I haven&rsquo;t been bored a working day in my life since my first job in 1992.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Whilst I loved the past few years of Twitter/Facebook/SoLoMo/etc, nothing really new seemed to be happening there. The world of purely-online had become stale and repetitive. However the online+realworld was only just beginning.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I still find myself every day looking for things that could do with a bit of Sugru to improve/fix them. I live by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Fixer&rsquo;s Manifesto<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Check out my patent-pending Sugru Wall Fingers.</p>

<p>And wow, what a 12 months that Starter Kit kicked-off. I&rsquo;ve gone from a simple kit along with a soldering iron and multimeter to a desk covered in modules, wires, interfaces, sensors and microcontrollers.</p>
<p>In fact I still use the kit every day. Here&rsquo;s something I put together in 10 mins before I went to bed the other night. It&rsquo;s an 8 DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor with a cloned 4 Nokia 5110 mobile phone screen. The code is just a quick hack of two Adafruit examples from their libraries. Two modules, one resistor and an Arduino. That&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The real heroes for me are companies like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sparkfun<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adafruit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and of course the amazing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Arduino<!-- raw HTML omitted --> group. They blend learning, fun, Open Source and a commercial sensibility brilliantly. Long may they prosper.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Whilst we can all criticise many aspects of the RPi design (USB, SD card location etc), it doesn&rsquo;t matter. The fact that it exists and enables people to be creative is what matters. Every day I see new wonderfully crazy projects built using the Raspberry Pi. These would never have happened without it. Sure there are other cheap single board computers out there that people could have used, but they just didn&rsquo;t know about them. Awareness + Ideas is leading to incredible ingenuity.</p>
<p>One of my big challenges has been working out the best approach to reporting data online. The device that does this will need Wifi, not wired Ethernet and the numbers just never add up when I do it with Arduino. The obvious solution is a Raspberry Pi Model-A with a cheap USB Wifi dongle.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This gives me plenty of welly for running Node or Python and can interface easily with an Arduino. But I&rsquo;m still worried about that SD card dangling off the end. Most of the problems we&rsquo;ve had with RPi (apart from the USB horrors) have been related to either the SD card refusing to stay well-seated or it getting corrupted by reboots (usually caused by the aforementioned USB horror). The Beaglebone Black&rsquo;s use of on-board eMMC looks a lot more stable by comparison but the Google Group doesn&rsquo;t give me confidence that it is ready for primetime quite yet.</p>

<p>Her 7yo brother announced he wants to do a hockey mask and chainsaw. I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out how Jason got so into mainstream culture that a 7yo knows about him. We immediately came up with a way of doing it that won&rsquo;t offend too many people.</p>

<p>In a far-too-long-term project I&rsquo;m working on, I tried to reverse engineer a commercial product&rsquo;s wireless communications protocol. Of course I failed. So I ripped out the electronics from the device, soldered together an Arduino-compatible board, added a wireless module, loaded up the VirtualWire library and had my own protocol running perfectly with an hour or two of work.</p>
<p>Finally I have just ordered a board for health sensing that should be great fun and provide me with some useful Quantified Self (QS) data too.</p>
