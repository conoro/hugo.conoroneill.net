      <p>#&ldquo;An evening in the company of the delightful Mr Samsung Galaxy S4&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re dying to know how I&rsquo;m getting on with the S4. How many of you struggled to sleep last night with the anticipation?</p>
<p>Where to start? That screen, OMFG that screen. 5&quot; of bright full 1080p HD. I played the classic Big Buck Bunny 1080p video and everything was crisper than crisp. I haven&rsquo;t used it in bright sunlight yet but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s as crap as all modern phones.</p>
<p>How does the phone look? I couldn&rsquo;t give two hoots. I buy phones as tools, not fashion accessories. Having said that, I wouldn&rsquo;t be seen dead with a white one ;-)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/galaxys4/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1017" alt="gal_03" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/gal_03.jpg" width="630" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>The lightness of the S4 can be disconcerting when the buzzer gives haptic feedback but I&rsquo;ll happily take lightness over a brick in my pocket any day. Oddly, the phone doesn&rsquo;t feel big at all. In some ways it feels smaller than the HTC Sensation.</p>
<p>Whilst I always hated HTC Sense and far prefer the Stock AOSP Android experience, I don&rsquo;t find TouchWiz that objectionable. Given that I spend 95% of my time on a phone inside apps, it doesn&rsquo;t really affect me that much. It still has the powerful system-wide sharing features of Android and the still excellent (but now very cluttered) notification bar.</p>
<p>Of course it comes with a ton of Samsung junk Apps, just like HTC. I tried them all (Hub, Fitness, Story Book etc etc) but just can&rsquo;t see the point of using single-vendor apps when I can use third-party ones from Google, Endomondo, Evernote or Amazon and bring everything with me if I switch to another vendor in the future.</p>
<p>Games, as you&rsquo;d expect are blazingly fast and look gorgeous. I did find one or two that crapped out at launch tho. I&rsquo;d love to know why.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read a lot of negativity about the &ldquo;gimmick&rdquo; features involving hand swipes and eye tracking but I was surprised to find that I really liked both.</p>
<p>By tracking the location of your eye, it can auto-scroll web-pages etc when it notices your head tilt. I was easily able to start, stop and rewind a web-page using it. The big down side is that it only seems to work in Samsung apps. I&rsquo;d love to see this in Twitter apps in particular.</p>
<p>The hand-waving is more gimmicky and allows you to scroll through photo albums etc. I just liked the ability to check the lock-screen for messages/missed-calls by waving my hand over the phone on my desk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to trying out Bluetooth 4.0 on my Fitbit. I don&rsquo;t think the sync is currently working but they said on Twitter that they are going to test this week. I also don&rsquo;t know if Android finally has BLE support to avoid big battery drain onconnecteddevices.I&rsquo;m a big fan of the idea of NFC for payments so I&rsquo;ll give that a go when I have a chance.</p>
<p>Another gimmicky thing that I like is the IR blaster built into the headphone socket. My eldest daughter thought it was pointless but I liked being able to change channel/volume on the TV without hunting for the remote.</p>
<p>One annoyance, not specific to the Galaxy is the term &ldquo;16GB&rdquo;. This is total storage so you only start out with 9GB user storage, which I have already filled. Hence the absolute need for an SD card slot. I have a 32GB microSD on the way from Amazon. Side-note: This is a UHS-1 card which has 48Mbs throughput in certain cameras. Standard Class 10 SD is only 10Mbs. So I&rsquo;d love to know if Samsung has implemented a UHS interface on the S4 or if it&rsquo;s normal SD.</p>
<p>A big word of warning on the Dropbox integration. I just discovered that 4GB+ of the storage used on the phone was because it decided to auto-sync <strong><em>everything</em></strong> from Dropbox. Everything! Eventually I ran out of storage on the phone and it stopped syncing. To avoid this, disable the &ldquo;DocumentSync&rdquo; feature in Settings-&gt;Accounts-&gt;Cloud. Stupid stupid default Samsung, what were you thinking?</p>
<p>The phone is LTE and it should be fun to check out the download speeds the next time I&rsquo;m in London. Given that I&rsquo;m in Old Chapel, I can&rsquo;t even get GPRS without major arm-waving. I&rsquo;m looking forward to the 30Mbs that Pat Rabbitte has personally guaranteed we&rsquo;ll all have, as a minimum, by 2015.</p>
<p>And now, back to reality.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had much chance to try out the camera. But the few initial pics were superb. I&rsquo;ll definitely be giving 1080p 30fps video a try out this week. Here&rsquo;s a quick example in bad light in my office:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/20130428_201032.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1016" alt="20130428_201032" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conoroneill.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/20130428_201032-1024x576.jpg" width="584" height="328" /></a></p>
<p>A few other notes. The charger is 2 Amp and a useful compact size. The charger cable useless at a metre too short. The phone uses microSIMs so make sure you leave the shop the right kind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try out some of the more obscure features in the next few weeks and then promptly forget about them.</p>
<p>Vodafone will force you to &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; to Red Essentials at a minimum if you are on an older cheaper plan. So I&rsquo;m now paying 5 a month extra for 500MB a month less data. You stay classy Vodafone.</p>
<p>One final note to Samsung. It would be a huge help if you&rsquo;d do a phone-specific Samsung-branded sports armband, particularly since you now have this sports app. I&rsquo;m really shooting in the dark with ordering on Amazon.</p>
<p>Look, you can&rsquo;t really go wrong with most mid to high end Android phones nowadays. If you get the S4 or the One or the Z or the Nexus4 or the whatever, you&rsquo;ll probably be more than happy. The S4 packs an amazing raft of features into a pleasantly small package. I think I&rsquo;m going to be happy with it for the next two years.</p>
