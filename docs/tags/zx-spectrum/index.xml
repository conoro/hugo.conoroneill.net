      <description>The 1980s home computer retro scene remains very vibrant. I dip a toe in every so often and recently have been enjoying the new Speccy games that I&amp;rsquo;ve found on Indie Retro News.
One thing that caught my eye with these releases was the mentions of &amp;ldquo;engines&amp;rdquo;. It turns out that people have been building games engines for the ZX Spectrum for years. Mostly in C it seems and mostly using the z88dk toolchain.</description>
