The most infuriating aspect of Buzz (and boy are there lots of them) is how a comment by some random stranger on a message by some stranger you follow, is considered so urgently important that it immediately jumps to the top of your page. I've said it before and I'll say it again, this product could never have been tested by anyone with more than about 3 friends. <a class="read-more" href="/2010/02/16/dr-cooper-explains-how-new-buzz-messages-appear/">&raquo;</a></p>

Yep, still Alpha, still very rough, but any OS that boots in a few seconds (faster than my phone in fact) and has me online a few seconds later has something going for it
Looking forward to seeing it tweaked for a tablet. HTML5 annnnnd Flash.

  via engadget.com I thought the N810 was the final nail in the coffin of Maemo since there was no senior management support for it. So I was thrilled they released the N900. Now everyone knows that high-end Nokia Smartphones will all eventually be Maemo even if Nokia can't admit it yet. Meego is a really smart move. A genuine fully-open competitor to Android that runs on a wide range of devices with two giants behind it. <a class="read-more" href="/2010/02/15/nokia-fightin-back/">&raquo;</a></p>

I've been making my own little client sign-up workflow inside Wordpress but there is a definite opportunity for someone to build a mini-workflow-engine for WP.Just pages/forms with strong conditional logic and branching and go-back. My kludge with a long page hierarchy, smart url naming and Gravity Forms will do in the short term but I could really do with the branching to separate pages based on input to forms (e. <a class="read-more" href="/2010/02/14/anyone-got-a-workflow-engine-for-wordpress/">&raquo;</a></p>
