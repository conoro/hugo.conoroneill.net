The most infuriating aspect of Buzz (and boy are there lots of them) is how a comment by some random stranger on a message by some stranger you follow, is considered so urgently important that it immediately jumps to the top of your page. I&rsquo;ve said it before and I&rsquo;ll say it again, this product could never have been tested by anyone with more than about 3 friends. <a class="read-more" href="/2010/02/16/dr-cooper-explains-how-new-buzz-messages-appear/">&raquo;</a></p>

Yep, still Alpha, still very rough, but any OS that boots in a few seconds (faster than my phone in fact) and has me online a few seconds later has something going for it
Looking forward to seeing it tweaked for a tablet. HTML5 annnnnd Flash.

  via engadget.com I thought the N810 was the final nail in the coffin of Maemo since there was no senior management support for it. So I was thrilled they released the N900. Now everyone knows that high-end Nokia Smartphones will all eventually be Maemo even if Nokia can&rsquo;t admit it yet. Meego is a really smart move.
