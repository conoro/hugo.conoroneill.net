        <p>Gen-X nerds continue to ruin the internet for Gen-Z by implementing RSS feeds for TikTok üòÅ
I was really intrigued by the launch of GitHub OCTO Flat Data, having already been a longtime fan of [Simon Willison&rsquo;s](https://simonwillison.net/] work (all the way back to the early days of Django). There is something very powerful in there that is not obvious on first look. Connecting it to Low-Code platforms could unleash lots of crazy fabulous new ideas. <a class="read-more" href="/2021/07/15/tiktok-rss-feeds-using-github-octo-flat-data/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>My Huawei P30 Pro takes great panoramic photos but Instagram isn&rsquo;t able to use them properly. The trick is to split them into multiple 1080x1080 photos (up to 10 of them) and include all of them in one post. People can then swipe right and left to get a pseudo-panoramic view.
There are lots of ad-supported or pay-for apps to do this in the Google Play Store. But I figured it was hardly difficult to do. <a class="read-more" href="/2021/07/12/pano2insta-panoramic-photo-to-instagram-converter/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Many of us remember the cultural ignorance of Yahoo deleting GeoCities and Twitter deleting Posterous off the web. Those responsible are no better than library arsonists.
Whether you think all of that published creativity was rubbish or amazing, there is something very wrong with it all just disappearing. The Internet Archive does an amazing job but it&rsquo;s simply impossible for it to keep up.
So I&rsquo;ve taken it as a bit of a challenge to try and keep as much old content as possible online if I&rsquo;ve been involved with it. <a class="read-more" href="/2021/01/17/preserving-old-sites-importance-of-github/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about tools for non-developers for several years. It seems to me that all the big players are leaving behind this important group. They keep talking about citizen developers, low-code and no-code. But the focus is on &ldquo;code&rdquo;, so most of the world will self-select out of using any of those tools, including the no-code ones.

        <p>It&rsquo;s always this time of year when I say I&rsquo;ll definitely blog more next year. I was also sure I&rsquo;d blog tons during lockdown but I was busy doing other things.
This is the type of post I used to do very regularly on this blog so I thought I&rsquo;d ease myself back in with a simple one.
If you access Samba/SMB shares on your home network via the stock PCManFM file manager on your Raspberry Pi, you&rsquo;ll probably have hit the problem that it forgets the password on reboot, even tho you ticked &ldquo;remember forever&rdquo;. <a class="read-more" href="/2020/12/08/pcmanfm-raspberry-pi-smb-samba-password/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>When NearForm Research announced Bangle.js at NodeConf EU with Gordon Williams from Espruino, we highlighted the uniqueness of having an inexpensive off-the-shelf Chinese smartwatch running both JavaScript and Google&rsquo;s TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers.
Whilst hardcore technology people got the implications of this, most people didn&rsquo;t. You can now run Machine Learning models directly on the $5 chip inside a watch and do all of the interaction inside a web browser.

        <p>Like many people I&rsquo;m excited by all of the possibilities opened up with WebAssembly/WASM. Most recently I&rsquo;ve been keeping an eye on Wasmer and similar projects that enable WASM outside of the browser.
So when I saw that you can now run it on a Raspberry Pi, I had to give it a try. But it&rsquo;s not quite as straightforward as the article suggests and this is what I had to do to get it working. <a class="read-more" href="/2019/12/02/running-wasmer-on-a-raspberry-pi-4-with-64bit-userland/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Ten years ago today, I received my first Android phone, an HTC G1, from a US eBay seller.
Here it is, still working! It&rsquo;s sitting on an Amazon Fire HD (stunningly good value) beside a Huawei Honor Play (a stand-in for my broken Galaxy S8+ and a fantastic phone at a crazy low price).
It&rsquo;s hard to imagine now, but back then, Android was nowhere. The G1 was the first Android device and many thought it compared very badly to the equivalent iPhone. <a class="read-more" href="/2018/11/25/a-decade-since-my-first-android-phone-the-htc-g1/">&raquo;</a></p>
