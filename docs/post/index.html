        <p>Our journey with media players started a long time ago by adding a hardware hack to an original pre-360 XBOX so it could run XBMC. We&rsquo;ve gone through a bunch of devices since, with the Raspberry Pi being the mainstay since 2012, until its lack of x265, 4K and Netflix meant we had to look elsewhere in 2017.
Quick side-note: By complete coincidence, XMBC has just been released today on the XBOX One. <a class="read-more" href="/my-media-players-in-2017/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The parents both got new iPhone 8&rsquo;s for Christmas. I figured it&rsquo;d take 10 minutes to tranfer them from a 5s and a 6 respectively. Boy was I wrong.
Five hours later I finally had them both working ok. Hopefully this post will save you some of my pain with these magical seamless awesome incredible devices (as Tim likes to call them).

        <p>Last night I setup a monitor in the 12yo&rsquo;s room for his Android media box and his Nintendo Switch. He told me not to bother setting up the Wii. And I was kinda sad.
We became a Nintendo house in 2005 with my US purchase of the original DS for the 6yo. This September he started college. In that time we have bought DS Lites, DSis and 3DSes. And some of them are still in intermittent use from the 18yo down to the 11yo. <a class="read-more" href="/end-of-an-era-our-wii-is-going-in-the-attic/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Intro After the silly complexity and Hackaday article! of last year, I decided to keep it simple for Halloween this year. Of course that worked out :-)
The kids&rsquo; favourite thing from all our Halloweens was the doorbell that made scary sounds. So that became the focus. As I hadn&rsquo;t really done anything with my two C.H.I.P.s, I picked one to handle the bulk of the activity. I immediately became a big fan of its small size, built-in Wifi and simple Linux UI. <a class="read-more" href="/all-the-grisly-details-of-skeletony-and-the-halloween-doorbell-of-doom-v20/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A couple of weeks ago, I took my Galaxy S6 out for a run in the rain and it died. Based on previous experience with the horror known as Vodafone Ireland Insurance, I figured I&rsquo;d be looking at 10 days minimum to get a replacement. This proved 100% accurate as the usual completely inept software that connects Vodafone&rsquo;s PDP-11 to Stay Mobile&rsquo;s Commodore 64 had cancelled my insurance without notification several months previously. <a class="read-more" href="/quick-review-of-the-blu-life-mark-android-phone/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Like my kids, I love regular YouTubers. My particular favourites are the tech, craft, metal and woodworking people who make amazing things every week. Those gals and guys have to be watched to really get the value from them and here&rsquo;s a few more worth looking at too, of course not forgetting these other gems.
But there are others I love equally where it&rsquo;s mostly about what they are saying. For example, Ethan Newberry (aka The Ginger Runner) does a fantastic weekly live session where he mostly interviews Ultra runners. <a class="read-more" href="/introducing-ytpodders---get-your-fave-youtubers-as-audio-podcasts-on-your-phone/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I previously wrote about using gccgo to build Go binaries for the Onion Omega due to Go&rsquo;s lack of support for MIPS CPUs. But TBH it&rsquo;s a pain in the butt. Things were looking up when it was revealed that Go 1.6 would have MIPS support but sadly it&rsquo;s for MIPS64 only, for datacenter applications I guess.
However Cathal Garvey discovered a GitHub repo where some lovely person has ported v1. <a class="read-more" href="/three-ways-to-build-go-1.4-binaries-for-mips32-onion-omega/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>When the incredible $5 Pi Zero was launched, the usual suspects were so busy snarking how it wasn&rsquo;t really $5, that they completely missed what an important moment in computer history this is. You know the type. The ones who would have ridiculed Tim Berners-Lee&rsquo;s design for the web. Or would have told Linus in no uncertain terms that he was misguided and that microkernels were the future.
Whilst you can&rsquo;t turn on a #PiZero for $5, you also can&rsquo;t connect to the LAN with your $1500 Macbook Pro without buying an adapter. <a class="read-more" href="/how-cheaply-can-you-build-a-full-raspberry-pizero-computer/">&raquo;</a></p>
