      <description>My wonderful late mother-in-law Mary bought us an original massive George Foreman Lean Mean Grilling Machine more than 10 years ago. Like most people we discovered it was pretty rubbish at cooking almost everything but was a superb toasted sandwich maker. With 5 kids, we have easily toasted thousands of cheese-based sambos.
Unfortunately, as with all non-stick surfaces, eventually it wore away on the grill until it became a stick surface.</description>

      <title>An RSS Feed for the Google Chrome Developer Blog</title>

      <description>Yesterday I was amused and faux-shocked to see that the company who did more to damage RSS than any other, got rid of the RSS feed for its Chrome Developer Blog.
So this morning I gave ChatGPT a few nudges/samples and it generated a basic Python script to create the feed. GitHub Copilot took care of some refinements and GitHub Actions took care of generating the feed once per hour and providing it via GitHub Pages.</description>

      <title>EPA Ireland Submission Data available as RSS, CSV and SQLite</title>

      <description>Whilst there is a ton of useful data on the EPA Ireland web-site, it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly easy to track what&amp;rsquo;s going on. After my recent RSS post, I got a request from Ashley to see if something better was doable with the EPA data.
After a bit of playing around I was able to scrape the thousands of individual RSS feeds and generate what is hopefully helpful to those of you who wish to monitor submissions on the site.</description>

      <description>Bring out your dead I&amp;rsquo;m that guy, the one who never gave up on blogs and never ever gave up on RSS. &amp;ldquo;Let me tell you, young whippersnappers, what the Internet was like in 2007, it was glorious,&amp;rdquo; etc.
My GitHub account is mostly just a collection of scrapers to turn webpages into RSS for all those companies who have killed their feeds over the years. RSS and advertising never really made good bedfellows.</description>

      <description>Sir Clive launched the greatest home computer of all time on April 23rd 1982, almost 40 years ago. I got mine in late 1982 and I still have it. Better, faster, stronger.
I wanted to do something to mark the occasion and decided to play around with Z88DK, a C Compiler and toolchain for 8-bit micros like the Speccy. It runs on Windows, Mac and Linux and it turned out to be ridiculously easy to write programs using it.</description>

      <description>Two things happened in early 2012 that have made the past almost-decade a geeky joy - I discovered the Arduino project and the first Raspberry Pi was released. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve had a ridiculous amount of fun with both and built a ton of useful and useless projects.
Despite having a Masters degree in Electronics, I&amp;rsquo;ve never worked as a Electronic Engineer and have always lived in the software world. I&amp;rsquo;d often wanted to dabble over the years but everything seemed just too difficult.</description>

      <description>It looks like I first started talking about MongoDB online back in 2011 - We&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way baby.
Right, need to finish watching the MongoDB vids (easier than I thought) and then do an Amazon ELB setup for kicks.
&amp;mdash; Conor O&amp;#39;Neill (@conoro) May 28, 2011  Mongo has remained one of my favourite tools for getting things done. I always think that&amp;rsquo;s why it succeeded. Whilst the factions argued it out on HN, developers just got on with using it for practical purposes.</description>

      <title>No-Code Halloween Hacking with Blockly, Espruino and Node-RED</title>

      <description>Every Halloween for the past decade or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve built something silly to scare or entertain the trick-or-treaters. Some years it works brilliantly, other years, not so well. But the basic idea is always the same - detect arrival of kids and use sound/light/motion to jump-scare them.
And every Halloween is a last-minute race to assemble electronics, plastic, duct-tape and code. That code is often a horrendous unreliable mish-mash of Arduino, Espruino, Python, Node.</description>

      <description>TL;DR - Gordon Williams has a new Espruino Kickstarter for the fabulous Bangle.js 2. Go and back the project and enjoy every geeky minute of playing with it. I have one of the devices already and it&amp;rsquo;s a massive leap forward over V1. Imagine running JavaScript and TensorFlow Micro machine learning on your wrist!
I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure how I heard about the Espruino project originally back in 2013. Hackaday maybe?</description>

      <description>As long-time readers of my blog(s) know, I come from an Embedded Systems background and still love to play with home electronics and IoT. And of course, since last year I&amp;rsquo;ve been noodling around with CO2 monitors and other environmental sensors because of you-know-what.
So I decided to see if I could connect my sensor setup to Low Code platforms like Node-RED, parse the values, persist them and alert me somehow if CO2 in particular got too high.</description>

      <title>A quick thought on failed computers in education</title>

      <description>I saw two related threads over the past few days about computers in education.
Walter retweeted one which called the Rasperry Pi a failure as it didn&amp;rsquo;t achieve its original mission.
Clickbait title time: The Raspberry Pi failed (a thread).
The original mission statement of the Pi was to be a modern BBC computer - a cheap educational resource that could be scattered throughout schools for kids to learn on.</description>

      <description>Gen-X nerds continue to ruin the internet for Gen-Z by implementing RSS feeds for TikTok 😁
I was really intrigued by the launch of GitHub OCTO Flat Data, having already been a longtime fan of Simon Willison&amp;rsquo;s work (all the way back to the early days of Django). There is something very powerful in there that is not obvious on first look. Connecting it to Low-Code platforms could unleash lots of crazy fabulous new ideas.</description>

      <title>Pano2Insta - Panoramic photo to Instagram converter</title>

      <description>My Huawei P30 Pro takes great panoramic photos but Instagram isn&amp;rsquo;t able to use them properly. The trick is to split them into multiple 1080x1080 photos (up to 10 of them) and include all of them in one post. People can then swipe right and left to get a pseudo-panoramic view.
There are lots of ad-supported or pay-for apps to do this in the Google Play Store. But I figured it was hardly difficult to do.</description>

      <title>Preserving old blogs/sites and the importance of GitHub</title>

      <description>Many of us remember the cultural ignorance of Yahoo deleting GeoCities and Twitter deleting Posterous off the web. Those responsible are no better than library arsonists.
Whether you think all of that published creativity was rubbish or amazing, there is something very wrong with it all just disappearing. The Internet Archive does an amazing job but it&amp;rsquo;s simply impossible for it to keep up.
So I&amp;rsquo;ve taken it as a bit of a challenge to try and keep as much old content as possible online if I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved with it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about tools for non-developers for several years. It seems to me that all the big players are leaving behind this important group. They keep talking about citizen developers, low-code and no-code. But the focus is on &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo;, so most of the world will self-select out of using any of those tools, including the no-code ones. Even the title of Satya Nadella&amp;rsquo;s article this week is &amp;ldquo;Want a More Equitable Future?</description>

      <title>Getting PCManFM on your Raspberry Pi to remember SMB/Samba passwords</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s always this time of year when I say I&amp;rsquo;ll definitely blog more next year. I was also sure I&amp;rsquo;d blog tons during lockdown but I was busy doing other things.
This is the type of post I used to do very regularly on this blog so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d ease myself back in with a simple one.
If you access Samba/SMB shares on your home network via the stock PCManFM file manager on your Raspberry Pi, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably have hit the problem that it forgets the password on reboot, even tho you ticked &amp;ldquo;remember forever&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>When NearForm Research announced Bangle.js at NodeConf EU with Gordon Williams from Espruino, we highlighted the uniqueness of having an inexpensive off-the-shelf Chinese smartwatch running both JavaScript and Google&amp;rsquo;s TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers.
Whilst hardcore technology people got the implications of this, most people didn&amp;rsquo;t. You can now run Machine Learning models directly on the $5 chip inside a watch and do all of the interaction inside a web browser. If you can&amp;rsquo;t wait until Bangle.</description>

      <description>Like many people I&amp;rsquo;m excited by all of the possibilities opened up with WebAssembly/WASM. Most recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping an eye on Wasmer and similar projects that enable WASM outside of the browser.
So when I saw that you can now run it on a Raspberry Pi, I had to give it a try. But it&amp;rsquo;s not quite as straightforward as the article suggests and this is what I had to do to get it working.</description>

      <description>First things first, Gordon Williams&amp;rsquo;s KickStarter for Bangle.js finishes in three days. If you have interest in any of: sustainable Open Source, JavaScript, Machine Learning, wearables, Open APIs, health, hacking or IOT, you should back it. Heck even if you want to see what Chinese manufacturers are able to cram into an inexpensive device in 2019, you should get one.
Second - how did I manage to wait exactly one year between blogposts?</description>

      <description>Ten years ago today, I received my first Android phone, an HTC G1, from a US eBay seller.
Here it is, still working! It&amp;rsquo;s sitting on an Amazon Fire HD (stunningly good value) beside a Huawei Honor Play (a stand-in for my broken Galaxy S8+ and a fantastic phone at a crazy low price).
It&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine now, but back then, Android was nowhere. The G1 was the first Android device and many thought it compared very badly to the equivalent iPhone.</description>
