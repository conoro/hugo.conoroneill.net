      <description>One of the all-time great tools of the internet era is youtube-dl. It enables you to download any YouTube video for watching offline/later. It has been a fantastic boon over the years for watching all my hundreds of subscribed channels when in planes, trains, automobiles and treadmills. It&amp;rsquo;s also the basis for my own YTPodders tool for generating podcasts from videos.
Normally I run it on the PC and copy the files to the mobile devices, tablets or media players.</description>

      <description>If you attended NodeConf EU 2017 in Kilkenny, Ireland, you&amp;rsquo;ll know all about the digital badge powered by Espruino that we created with Gordon Williams. You can read more about it on the nearForm blog and check out the docs site.
I hope you&amp;rsquo;ve continued to learn about Espruino and the power of JavaScript on tiny microcontrollers. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget it&amp;rsquo;s entirely Open Source Software and Hardware. Our Github repo is here.</description>

      <title>My Media Players in 2017</title>

      <description>Our journey with media players started a long time ago by adding a hardware hack to an original pre-360 XBOX so it could run XBMC. We&amp;rsquo;ve gone through a bunch of devices since, with the Raspberry Pi being the mainstay since 2012, until its lack of x265, 4K and Netflix meant we had to look elsewhere in 2017.
Quick side-note: By complete coincidence, XMBC has just been released today on the XBOX One.</description>

      <description>The parents both got new iPhone 8&amp;rsquo;s for Christmas. I figured it&amp;rsquo;d take 10 minutes to tranfer them from a 5s and a 6 respectively. Boy was I wrong.
Five hours later I finally had them both working ok. Hopefully this post will save you some of my pain with these magical seamless awesome incredible devices (as Tim likes to call them).

      <description>Last night I setup a monitor in the 12yo&amp;rsquo;s room for his Android media box and his Nintendo Switch. He told me not to bother setting up the Wii. And I was kinda sad.
We became a Nintendo house in 2005 with my US purchase of the original DS for the 6yo. This September he started college. In that time we have bought DS Lites, DSis and 3DSes. And some of them are still in intermittent use from the 18yo down to the 11yo.</description>

      <description>I have a massive backlog of tech posts to do but I never quite finish the projects to the level I want and they are left hanging. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to start posting more WIP stuff from now on and hopefully they&amp;rsquo;ll be useful to someone.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been a long-time fan of the Espruino project created by Gordon Willams and have had great fun with the original board, the Pico and Puck.</description>

      <description>Intro After the silly complexity and Hackaday article! of last year, I decided to keep it simple for Halloween this year. Of course that worked out :-)
The kids&amp;rsquo; favourite thing from all our Halloweens was the doorbell that made scary sounds. So that became the focus. As I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really done anything with my two C.H.I.P.s, I picked one to handle the bulk of the activity. I immediately became a big fan of its small size, built-in Wifi and simple Linux UI.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago, I took my Galaxy S6 out for a run in the rain and it died. Based on previous experience with the horror known as Vodafone Ireland Insurance, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d be looking at 10 days minimum to get a replacement. This proved 100% accurate as the usual completely inept software that connects Vodafone&amp;rsquo;s PDP-11 to Stay Mobile&amp;rsquo;s Commodore 64 had cancelled my insurance without notification several months previously.</description>

      <description>Like my kids, I love regular YouTubers. My particular favourites are the tech, craft, metal and woodworking people who make amazing things every week. Those gals and guys have to be watched to really get the value from them and here&amp;rsquo;s a few more worth looking at too, of course not forgetting these other gems.
But there are others I love equally where it&amp;rsquo;s mostly about what they are saying. For example, Ethan Newberry (aka The Ginger Runner) does a fantastic weekly live session where he mostly interviews Ultra runners.</description>

      <title>Three ways to build Go 1.4 binaries for MIPS32 Onion Omega</title>

      <description>I previously wrote about using gccgo to build Go binaries for the Onion Omega due to Go&amp;rsquo;s lack of support for MIPS CPUs. But TBH it&amp;rsquo;s a pain in the butt. Things were looking up when it was revealed that Go 1.6 would have MIPS support but sadly it&amp;rsquo;s for MIPS64 only, for datacenter applications I guess.
However Cathal Garvey discovered a GitHub repo where some lovely person has ported v1.</description>

      <description> My Car Insurance Broker, 123.ie just offered me up to 10% off my 2016 premium if I installed a driving monitoring app on my phone.
No thanks
But when does it go from &amp;ldquo;get a discount&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;we won&amp;rsquo;t insure you unless you install this app&amp;rdquo;?

      <description>When the incredible $5 Pi Zero was launched, the usual suspects were so busy snarking how it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really $5, that they completely missed what an important moment in computer history this is. You know the type. The ones who would have ridiculed Tim Berners-Lee&amp;rsquo;s design for the web. Or would have told Linus in no uncertain terms that he was misguided and that microkernels were the future.
Whilst you can&amp;rsquo;t turn on a #PiZero for $5, you also can&amp;rsquo;t connect to the LAN with your $1500 Macbook Pro without buying an adapter.</description>

      <description>A completely random braindump of stuff that got my juices flowing this year.
ESP8266 $1 Wifi modules I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about the ESP8266 constantly all year. A price-point of ~$1 in volume means that you can wifi-enable anything. Where previously you might have used one of the many low bandwidth &amp;ldquo;IoT&amp;rdquo; protocols internally and connected them to hub-device, now you can do Wifi and IP end-to-end. The only downside is high power consumption.</description>

      <description>For the third year in a row I decided to build a new oven thermometer for the Christmas turkey, as all of the markings on our temperature knob have been gone for years. We also have one of those mechanical dial thermometers you place inside the oven but they are hard to read and get in the way. My last two attempts worked ok but I was concerned about accuracy.</description>

      <description>Intro I haven&amp;rsquo;t blogged properly about the $5 Raspberry Pi Zero computer yet, despite Tweeting non-stop about it. I will soon. In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;ll just repeat that
It&amp;rsquo;s a major moment in computing
 The inclusion of a free one on the cover of the MagPi Magazine will be remembered for years to come.
The town in which I live, Bandon, flooded again recently, because Ireland. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a simple Node.</description>

      <description>I switched this blog to the superb Go-based tool Hugo earlier in the year. Its staggering speed compared to HarpJS and Hexo plus a single executable you can drop in anywhere, make it a no-brainer for static blogs.
I continued to host for free on GitHub Pages which means I never ever ever have to worry about WordPress security exploits or badly written plugins again. However using GH Pages means you are quite limited in how things work.</description>

      <title>Simple Christmas Control of each LED in a 150 RGB LED WS2812 strip</title>

      <description>One mistake I made with our Halloween setup was buying an analogue RGB LED strip where all the LEDs had to be set to the same colour. Then a few weeks ago, Joe Desbonnet Facebooked about getting a waterproof WS2812 strip with individual LED control. And it wasn&amp;rsquo;t that much more expensive than the analogue one. Off to eBay I went and ordered one, far too late for Christmas.
So I was chuffed that it arrived on Christmas Eve.</description>

      <description>I did a splurge of backing IoT KickStarters a few months ago and the Onion Omega is the first one to land in my postbox. It&amp;rsquo;s a tiny (barely bigger than an SD card) board running the same basic guts as many OpenWRT routers i.e. 400 MHz Atheros MIPS CPU with 64MB of DRAM and 16MB of Flash.
If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with OpenWRT, it&amp;rsquo;s an Open Source community replacement firmware for many routers (similar to DD-WRT that I&amp;rsquo;ve used many times) and is Linux under the hood.</description>

      <description>Despite starting weeks earlier than usual, Halloween still involved a day of last minute panic to bring everything together. The end result was this:
 The basic setup was an update of ideas from previous years and consisted of the following.
3D-printed Mummy in Coffin Doorbell This was my favourite aspect of the whole thing. I spotted a cool 3D design on Thingiverse and realised I could turn it into a doorbell by dremeling a hole in the back and hot-glueing the mummy to a simple push button.</description>

      <description>AWS is now an $8Bn business for Amazon. Could anyone have predicted that in 1997 or even 2007? This week I was talking to a few people about who might be able to disrupt AWS. It won&amp;rsquo;t be easy. We immediately discounted the old guys like HP, IBM, Dell etc and even Google seems to be a complete also-ran in IaaS. Microsoft Azure might have potential.
PaaS is separate as it&amp;rsquo;s higher up the stack and makes use of IaaS.</description>

      <description>For some odd reason, Google and others stopped auto-generating armhf binaries of Chromium last year. Version 37 was the last one I could find. Luckily the Ubuntu guys have been building it all along and their version 45 installs really easily on the all-new Debian/Raspbian Jessie on your Raspberry Pi 2.
This was a surprise as this kind of thing usually degenerates into dependency hell.

      <description>As an old Embedded guy who actually cares about resource usage, I&amp;rsquo;ve been bothered for quite a while by the number of trivial Node.js projects out there that require a full-blown MongoDB or MySQL server to operate. It&amp;rsquo;s a particular problem on the Raspberry Pi or small DigitalOcean Droplets. In many cases a simple SQLite DB or TingoDB is more than sufficient.
If your Web App has 2 registered users and 100 visitors per day, may just maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t need MongoDB or MySQL.</description>

      <description>ZeroMQ is a lightweight messaging library and looks ideal for lower powered devices like the RPi. Building and running is pretty easy. These are really just notes for myself for future reference.
I don&amp;rsquo;t actually need a messaging system yet but I wanted to play around with one. Running a simple Request / Reply setup with Node.js on both Windows 10 and RPi was interesting. One advantage a message queue gives you over REST is that the receiver can be out of action and still get all transmitted messages when it recovers.</description>

      <description>We had friends over from the US last weekend and their kids loved my Printrbot 3D printer. They had learned Tinkercad in school so that&amp;rsquo;s what they used to create things so they could print them out. They are now hounding their parents for a printer. Oops :-) But I noticed a &amp;ldquo;Download to Minecraft&amp;rdquo; option in Tinkercad and finally just had a chance to try it out. Wow!
It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly easy.</description>

      <description>Now that the Espruino Pico has (beta) HID support, it can pretend to be a keyboard or mouse (or other HID compatible device). This makes it possible to send characters to the active window on your Windows/Linux/Mac PC. I&amp;rsquo;ve cobbled together some code which turns the Pico into a device like a YubiKey. Press the button and get the latest auth code pasted automatically for you.
This code is basically just from three sources, merged together with a few tiny tweaks by me.</description>

      <description>I compiled both on a Banana Pi for a change. Nothing special for the 0.12 build, and ./configure &amp;ndash;without-snapshot for the 0.10 build.
&amp;ldquo;make test&amp;rdquo; threw up the usual 7 minor errors or so.
I ran both Banana Pi and Raspberry Pi 2 without any immediate obvious issues.
Enjoy.

      <description>I swore I&amp;rsquo;d never use another Yahoo product after the cultural terrorism of their Geocities shutdown. Now one of their few bright lights of the past decade, Pipes, is biting the dust. However a very very smart person wrote a program called pipes2js three years ago which you may find useful. It converts your Pipes to Node.js apps!
Installation is a tiny bit different from the instructions as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be on NPM any more.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been Snarky McSnarkenstein about Windows 10 IoT on Raspberry Pi for quite a while. When it was originally announced, everyone seemed to think they were getting full-blown Windows for free on Pi. Many still think this. What you actually get is a GUI-less version of Windows on to which you can deploy Universal Apps (and others). So unlike Raspbian on Pi, you can&amp;rsquo;t actually develop on it, you have to have full Windows 10 running somewhere else to develop, compile, deploy and debug.</description>

      <description>As with Node 0.12.0 and 0.12.1, there are no-precompiled ARM versions of 0.12.2 on the main site.
I&amp;rsquo;ve built for Pi 1 (ARM v6) and ODROID-C1/Pi2 (ARM v7). The latter was built on an ODROID-C1 and it seems to run fine on the Pi 2 since both are ARM v7. It took 1 hr 15 mins to compile compared to 4+ hrs on the Pi 1.
&amp;ldquo;make test&amp;rdquo; on the ODROID gave the same results as on the Pi 1: [10:33|% 100|+ 784|- 4]: Done</description>

      <description>Unfortunately, just like 0.12.0, the 0.12.1 release of Node won&amp;rsquo;t compile on Raspberry Pi (pre 2) so I took a patch from io.js and was able to build it.
The problem is due to recent releases of Raspbian mis-identifying the ARM version so Node tries to build for V7 instead of V6. These two changes from this io.js thread sort it out.
I set the Raspberry Pi B+ to Turbo mode and it took 4ish hours to build</description>

      <description>After 3 years running as a Python script on a file server, the Bandon FEWS scraper is now running on an ODROID-C1 under Node.js and soon on OpenShift.
Introduction Cork County Council in Ireland has a site called Bandon FEWS (Bandon Flood Early Warning System). When the Bandon river hits certain levels near Bandon town, it alerts registered users via SMS in case they need to take emergency measures. It&amp;rsquo;s a very useful service and is very necessary due to the regular flooding that occurs.</description>

      <description>My first Fitbit died in the washing machine and they kindly replaced it for free. The replacement&amp;rsquo;s battery started acting up recently and finally gave up the ghost last night. You won&amp;rsquo;t believe what happens next ;-)
I figured out how to take apart the Fitbit One on the original dead one so this time I managed to do it with no damage. I de-soldered the battery and tried the old one instead.</description>

The very first Linux I installed was Slackware on a self-built AMD K5 PC in Sunnyvale in 1996 (I&amp;rsquo;ve never built a PC with Intel CPUs! Current box is self-built FX-8 Eight Core 8370).</description>

These posts are like a curated, contextualised version of my Pinboard account. Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping y&amp;rsquo;all find something useful below.

      <description>The acquisition of FeedHenry by Red Hat isn&amp;rsquo;t just one the most exciting tech stories in Ireland in 2014, it is also wonderfully satisfying for me as one of only two people in Product Management.
When I found out that Red Hat was negotiating to buy the company, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been happier. Apart from the almost perfect cultural fit, it was very cool to be joining a company whose products I first used in 1997 with Red Hat Linux 4.</description>

      <title>Some thoughts on Twitter rebuilding a developer ecosystem and how they might succeed</title>

      <description>First some very detailed background.
The Beginning: I joined Twitter in Feb 2007 so that I could live-Tweet the Irish Blog Awards results via SMS. It was when Twitter finally clicked with me. 2007-2008 was a fantastic time to be on Twitter if you had even a modicum of programming ability. There&amp;rsquo;s a chance it could be so again.
CorkProbs: Whilst LouderVoice took up 95% of my time around then, the other 5% was thinking about all of the incredible things that Twitter facilitated.</description>

      <description>This time it&amp;rsquo;s more about software than hardware. But first, hardware.
 Lightning: We had a lightning strike near our home a few weeks back and my main Windows desktop has been acting dodgy ever since. I swapped the PSU but that didn&amp;rsquo;t help and finally came to the conclusion that some of the USB ports were damaged on the motherboard. One replacement Gigabyte 970A-DS3P later and all seems to be well.</description>

      <description>Once you get out of the habit of blogging it can take ages to get back in the zone. A week&amp;rsquo;s vacation this week should do the trick for me. This is partially a link dump and partially the subjects of a bunch of upcoming posts.
 Red Hat acquired FeedHenry. I first installed Linux in 2006 when working in San Jose and was a Red Hat user all through those early years and into the initial Fedora years.</description>

      <description>I have long bemoaned Lego&amp;rsquo;s approach to adding electronics/power to their kits. Technics seems to be its own little sub-section and Mindstorms is a crazy waste of money in an Arduino and Raspberry Pi world. Now that they are the biggest toy company globally, I&amp;rsquo;d love to see how either of those product ranges are adding to the bottom line.
In that spirit I was very excited about the possibilities of the Lego Batman kit I got in Hamley&amp;rsquo;s recently.</description>

In 2012, I extended it to also save the data on Pachube/Cosm/Xively/Fleeglrheumazoid (or whatever insane name they have this week). So you have 2.5 years of river data in tabular and graphic form.
The code itself is very simple and just involved walking through the page (actually a bloody iframe!</description>

      <description>One small annoyance with the Baseline bolierplate in harp.js is that every blogpost needs to be listed in a file called _data.json with all the relevant metadata. Whilst it&amp;rsquo;s not a huge job to slug-ify a title and add the ID and epoch time, it&amp;rsquo;s sufficiently annoying to add friction to me blogging more. Here&amp;rsquo;s the entry for this blogpost:
&amp;quot;a-simple-nodejs-script-to-setup-a-new-blog-post-in-harpjs&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;ID&amp;quot;: 1291, &amp;quot;author&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;admin&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;date&amp;quot;: 1403504847928, &amp;quot;ptype&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;post&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;This little script generates the relevant metadata in the _data.</description>

      <description>Whilst there are tons of tools to do S3 upload, I wanted something tuned to how I blog, particularly with a static blog that used to be a WordPress one with year/month directories for images.
Usage:
node upload_s3_images.js image1.jpg image2.jpg image3.png etc  It uses your AWS credentials in ~/aws_config.json { &amp;ldquo;accessKeyId&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;akid&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;secretAccessKey&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;secret&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;region&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;us-west-2&amp;rdquo; }

      <description>After 7 long years, Twitter finally added people muting recently. Meanwhile those of us who never use the official apps and use Janetter etc instead have had powerful keyword filtering for years. I see Twitter has some silly &amp;ldquo;which team do you support in the World Cup&amp;rdquo; nonsense now. But they really aren&amp;rsquo;t thinking this through. There are many many many many people on Twitter who would happily never see a World Cup tweet.</description>

      <description>One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve run into many times is the lack of internet bandwidth at events. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to matter whether it is a big pay-for thing or a BarCamp - once everyone was online, things slowed to a crawl. This was a really big problem at Dojo Camp last year where we had to get a ton of kids setup with the Arduino IDE and other tools. In the end it was faster to pass around a USB key but we lost a lot of valuable time doing this.</description>

Our 8yo wanted a local server on his laptop today so I grabbed the latest 1.7.9 server exe from the Minecraft site and ran it in its own directory. It created the usual files and gave a GUI-style interface with no obvious console like the raw Java version. Fionn then asked me to make him an Op so he could change things.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to go to 3D Camp since it first started. It has been about a lot more than 3D for many years. I finally did it on Saturday and had an absolute blast. I met people I&amp;rsquo;ve been tweeting at since 2007 and really got the full BarCamp mojo whilst I was there. James Corbett, the organiser, was kind enough to mention that I helped to organise the first BarCamp in Ireland with Walter and Damien way back in 2006.</description>

      <description>Messing with hardware and software can be both a joy and incredibly infuriating. Yesterday I spent a few intermittent hours trying to get Arduino and Espruino communicating reliably over NRF24L01+ wireless transceivers. I only half succeeded. I followed this with some reading up on both CloudPebble and Simply.js. Literally 5 minutes later I had my first Pebble App installed on my watch and was remotely controlling the electric blanket in our bed.</description>

      <description>Now that I can talk to the Efergy remote control switches using Arduino and DigiX, it&amp;rsquo;s time to do the same thing with Raspberry Pi and Node.js.
But first, check out this gorgeous Pimoroni Pibow Timber case that the RPi now lives in. Makes me smile every time I look at it.
Start by plugging in one of the Efergy switches and using its remote control to set its code.</description>

      <description>A major ongoing struggle in our household is convincing one of our many children to go upstairs and put on the electric blanket for us. I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t know how we get through the winter.
Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be fantastic if we could use technology instead of children to do this?
Last Thursday I came home from work to discover that Electric Ireland had sent us three Efergy remote control power sockets and a plugin energy monitor.</description>

      <description>As I said in the previous posts, the move from WP to HarpJS was not exactly smooth. But I&amp;rsquo;m glad I&amp;rsquo;ve done it as I finally learned how to use a lot of things like Jade that I&amp;rsquo;ve long-fingered for years.
The first step was to get the original content out of WordPress. This had the added twist that the conoroneill.net blog actually started out as a Posterous blog which I imported into WordPress when I realised that Posterous was a dead-end.</description>

      <description>My blogging history goes back to 2001 when I setup a Blogger/Blogspot blog in the hope that I would update things more quickly than with Geocities or my Frontpage98 home page. 4 months later I wrote my second post :-) For a long time it involved writing the posts on Blogger and then publishing them via FTP to my own domain. It was fiddly but it worked ok.
Then around 2005 I discovered WordPress and realised blogging could be much much much easier.</description>

It hasn&amp;rsquo;t been as smooth a process as I&amp;rsquo;d hoped but I&amp;rsquo;ve learned lots. We&amp;rsquo;re also using HarpJS in a work context and it works great there running under Node. I&amp;rsquo;ll write it all up either this weekend or next.
Then this evening I asked myself the silly question &amp;ldquo;I wonder can I run Node.</description>

      <description>Using an S4 on a Mac Book Pro is an exercise in futility now that it and other phones no longer appear as a disk drive but as a weird media device. The Samsung Kies software doesn&amp;rsquo;t help and actually seems to make things worse. If you run Windows 7 inside VirtualBox you can see the phone&amp;rsquo;s storage but doesn&amp;rsquo;t see it when the phone is in upgrade mode. So you can&amp;rsquo;t run the usual Odin software there.</description>

      <description>In addition to the recent Andro100 box, the guys in TV Trade also gave me aÂ Sab Unix HD Triple Tuner box to try out. The specs on this thing were pretty amazing for something that costs approx â¬130+VAT so I was intrigued to see how well it did. After the reliability horror that was the Ferguson Ariva 120 pile of junk, I went in with open eyes.
The box itself is pretty compact with a 1980s Amstrad stereo vibe off it with the chrome accents.</description>

Last night after a few glasses of vino, I decided to make a simple blinking LED circuit but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to involve Arduinos, just discrete components.
Most of that auld internet does them with 555 timers but I don&amp;rsquo;t have any of those so much googling ensued. I finally found one and tried to make it, learning in the process that soldering and Sauvignon Blanc don&amp;rsquo;t mix:</description>

It was huge in our school. I even had the special plastic medallion/key. For some reason I managed to block out his &amp;lsquo;tache in my memory. Here are two pics from Google Images which match my own experience.

Secret codes and invisible ink were major parts of my youth. I wonder if we could use something similar to get kids interested in privacy and crypto ;-)</description>

I just got my Kickstarter Espruino yesterday. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those projects that just makes me smile. A tiny board with an ST ARM MCU running a special JavaScript interpreter that can do all the stuff with hardware you would normally associate with C/C++/Assembler/Wiring.

I&amp;rsquo;ve only just got started playing with it and I swear it feels like my first days using a ZX Spectrum.</description>

David in TV Trade very kindly gave me an AND100 Android Box before Christmas and I&amp;rsquo;m only now finally getting around to reviewing it.

I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping an eye on the whole Android TV Stick/Box market for a while. There are so many out there, it is almost impossible to pick one and I haven&amp;rsquo;t been overly impressed with the sticks due to all the compromises involved in getting everything into such a small form factor.</description>

After many many years on a barely-used 1024-bit GPG/PGP key, I decided to go full-blown 4096-bit recently. More for the principle than anything else, but also to mess around with some secure apps like Retroshare, as mentioned by Cathal Garvey.
Whilst I was as it, I moved to a new much improved longer password and made sure to drill it into my brain over and over.</description>

The idea behind this was to highlight how Lego could do something really powerful for a much wider range of kids than the insanely priced Mindstorms.
I started with this really impressive Lego Technic Dune Buggythat some of my kids assembled ages ago.

I then butchered it and added a geared motor, a motor shield, an Arduino Uno, a LiPo battery, an nRF24L01 transceiverand a servo to create FrankenLego:</description>

Take one turkey, an oven with the temperature markings rubbed-off, a food thermometer with a broken probe and you have a recipe for either incineration or salmonella.
Enter an Arduino Uno, a K-Type thermocouple, a sample MAX31855 IC, some dodgy soldering from a few weeks ago, an Adafruit library and a Sparkfun LCD and you get this:

All rustled up in 15 minutes.

I watched a superb Culture Show documentary on Doctor Who last week. Several people really stood out for me including Delia Derbyshire, the absolute genius who, at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop in 1963,turned Ron Grainer&amp;rsquo;s simple tune into the iconic music that is burned into my brain since I first heard it around 1972, aged 4.

I&amp;rsquo;ve just been wondering this week how she did it.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Introducing the Bandon Bluetooth Button (BBB) using RN42 HID&amp;rdquo;
TL;DR - A Bluetooth-enabled Button/Joystick to control music/podcasts on your phone whilst driving.

One thing I find very dangerous in the car is changing tracks etc on my phone when it&amp;rsquo;s in its screen mount. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to do so without taking your eye off the road even for a second. And it&amp;rsquo;s illegal in many countries. I used to love the steering column controls for the old car radio but they don&amp;rsquo;t work over A2DP or AVRCP Bluetooth to my phone which streams to my Lidl car stereo.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Adding a realtime clock to the Raspberry Pi and the Sweetbox II&amp;rdquo;
I got one of these $3 RTC modulesa few months back and I finally set it up this weekend. It simply has a battery-backed clock so when your Raspberry Pi (or Arduino) boots up, it has the correct time immediately. For a network-connected Pi, it&amp;rsquo;s not really necessary as you can have the time updated regularly via NTP but not all Pis spend their life connected to the network.</description>

I was wrong.

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;A Tech Halloween mainly made of fail&amp;rdquo;
This year I decided to be completely out of character and start Halloween preparations over a month ahead of time. The plans were ambitious to put it mildly. Vampires flying along guidewires, 10 feet in the air. Screaming skeletons jumping up out of bushes. Creepy crawlies automatically lowering on the heads of trick-or-treaters. You get the idea.
The reality was that almost everything took 4x as long to do as expected and I killed more tech trying to test things than actually survived.</description>

 Espruino got funded and hit all the stretch goals. Hurrah! JavaScript on a microcontroller for a pittance. Going to be fun playing with this stuff. It made me realise that, along with the incredible ecosystem around the Raspberry Pi, how important the UK still is in technology. That Engineering culture hasn&#39;t gone away despite the destruction of the manufacturing sector since the 70s.</description>

I splashed out a little on my main dev Raspberry Pi and finally got it a PiBow case. I&amp;rsquo;ve loved that design for so long, I had to succumb.

Coincidentally the same company now has a brilliant new USB hub specifically for the RPi called the PiHUB. Not only is it in that hilarious shape, but it also comes with a 3A PSU.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Arduino and Raspberry Pi communicating over 2.4GHz with cheap nRF24L01+ modules&amp;rdquo;
I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of fun over the past year messing with wireless comms. The 433Mhz/434MHz dirt-cheap modules are fantastic for Arduino, particularly when used with the VirtualWire library which makes them trivial to setup. I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to send sensor data and RC car commands using them with just a few lines of code. However, there isn&amp;rsquo;t a version of VirtualWire for RaspberryPi and I don&amp;rsquo;t have the time/skills to port the Arduino one.</description>

 Thrilled to find that Bluetooth on this Play Edition ROM for SGS4 works perfectly. I&#39;ve gone from 20% success rate auto-connecting to my Lidl car stereo to 100%, Finally! Nodeconf Europe is on in Waterford Mon-Wed. Incredible line-up of speakers. Superb IoT sessions set for Monday. A conference driven by expertise, not bullshit-artists hyping vapourware. Ordered an Espruino - run JS on an MCU This --------&amp;gt; &amp;lt;-------- close to ordering a Tessel - moar JS on an MCU, this time with NPM support Waiting to order an Arduino Yun= Arduino + Wifi machine + bridge libraries Of course I had to back this Pressy button for my Android phone.</description>

Weather Signal - Crowd Sourced weather using the sensors in your phone. I have it installed on my SGS4 already.

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;A year of falling back in love with Making/Electronics on Raspberry Pi and Arduino&amp;rdquo;
The 80s As I have mentioned many many times, my adventure with computers began properly in late 1982 with my parents getting me a ZX Spectrum. I went from BASIC to Forth to Z80 Assembler over a few years and loved it all. Ok, to be fair, 90% of that time was spent playing Jet Set Willy.</description>

Regular readers will know that I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of the Dagu Arexx i-racer RC car. It&amp;rsquo;s cheap, light, fast, uses Bluetooth, has a removable shell and is perfect for n00b families like us who have never really done the RC thing properly.
Unfortunately after some over-exhuberant use recently, we broke a part of the suspension on one of the front wheels.</description>

After my Fitbit One took a swim in a full washing machine cycle, it died. Many attempts with rice and pampers and warm air over a few days failed to bring it back. The utterly fantastic customer support people in Fitbit then offered me a free replacement! The only tiny downside is that they don&amp;rsquo;t deliver to Ireland so I needed to use a Parcel Motel address.</description>

Overall, at 10 it is totally worth a punt if you don&amp;rsquo;t have an iron already.
Regarding the non-standard tips, it turns out there are compatible replacements out there. This seller on eBay has some.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Connecting an Arduino to Raspberry Pi for the best of both worlds&amp;rdquo;
Rather than struggle with the very basic unprotected IO pins on the Raspberry Pi and the lack of real-time performance in Linux, the ideal setup for many real-world-interfacing projects is Raspberry Pi + Arduino.
After pricing a multitude of combinations of microcontroller boards and Wifi adapters, I found that the Raspberry Pi + USB Wifi + Arduino is the absolute best value for money if you need both wireless internet access and easy sensor data handling.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve obviously been into the whole SoLoMo thing since first getting my hands on an N95-8GB in 2007 and I&amp;rsquo;ve been generating lots and lots of location data since then. But location is really only step zero.</description>

The VR512 cost me around 399 in 1992 in the Philips employee sale. A staggeringly good top-of-the-range VCR that did sterling service for over a decade.
The XBOX One is a mid-range PC with a small hard disk and VR512 inspired case. Oh but it has Skype. Like every PC since 2003.</description>

Whilst I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of the Arduinoinitiative(is &amp;ldquo;initiative&amp;rdquo;the right word?), its programming language, Wiring, is still fundamentally C with most of its power but also most of its difficulty.
C was the fifth language I learned after ZX Spectrum BASIC, Forth, Z80 assembler and Fortran (spit). I then spent the next 13 years using little else. But here I am still struggling to read a number from a sensor, add it to an ascii string, send it over a wireless link and then convert that back to a number at the far end.</description>

There are many ways you can add remote control to a project. Off the shelf modules; Bluetooth; 2.4GHz NRF24L01+ transceivers; 433MHz/434Mhz modules or even Infra-red.

My plan with our ZL-4 el-cheapo RC car was to use an Elecfreaks Joystick Shield, an Arduino board and theNRF24L01+ modules mainly because [a] the joystick shield has a connector for one and [b] I want to use them in another potentiallycommercialproject and thought it would be a good learning exercise.</description>

To try them out, I installed the NFC Task Launcher and Tasker Apps. The former enables you to do things like change Wifi settings, volume, display, sync email or even Tweet when it detects a configured NFC sticker.</description>

As I mentioned before, the Eken&amp;rsquo;s battery life iscatastrophic Sometimes less than 45 mins. Even at idle, it dies in no time at all. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing one of its two cells isn&amp;rsquo;t actually functional.
The eBay replacement quotes 3500mAh which I&amp;rsquo;ll take with a big grain of salt.</description>

Where to start? That screen, OMFG that screen. 5&amp;rdquo; of bright full 1080p HD. I played the classic Big Buck Bunny 1080p video and everything was crisper than crisp. I haven&amp;rsquo;t used it in bright sunlight yet but I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;s as crap as all modern phones.</description>

My first actual &amp;ldquo;Smartphone&amp;rdquo; was a Nokia N70 but it has the dubious pleasure of being the only phone I ever lost. The one that really got me using Apps and understanding the importance of SoLoMo was the classic N95-8GB which I loved despite its numerous flaws. It was also the most I ever spent on a phone.
When I realised that Android would be an unstoppable juggernaut, I got a HTC G1 back in Nov 2008, shortly after it was released.</description>

And bykuvitteellinen, of course I mean the Finnish for imaginary.
What do you think this is:

I must get 20 emails a day asking the same question: &amp;ldquo;Conor, what temperature is it,right now, outside your office window?&amp;ldquo;. Thankfully, after literally several minutes work, you have your answer.
Courtesy of an Arduino Nano, Ethernet adapter and Sparkfun temperature breakout board, I can exclusively reveal the temperature is12.44C and 54.39F i.e. about 2C higher than reality.
To get something more accurate I&amp;rsquo;ll need to put the sensor away from the building, away from the ground, out of direct sunlight and with good air flow.</description>

My daughter&amp;rsquo;s Eken T02 is still going strong after nearly a year but it still has the same two problems as ever. [a] the accuracy of the touch screen is awful and [b] it barely lasts 45mins on battery.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can do anything about the first problem but I decided last week to sort out the second one.</description>

I was very disappointed to realise that Endomondo has no API. The best they can do for pushing your activities elsewhere is built-in Facebook/Twitter and some widgets. When will companies learn that lock-in is not how you keep customers?
I&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to push my activities to sites like App.net, Tumblr or anywhere really.</description>

I use a lot of TP-Link gear for home stuff. It&amp;rsquo;s as cheap as chips and the hardware is usually totally reliable. But the software, dear god the software. I cannot understand why Chinese manufacturers of cheap networking gear don&amp;rsquo;t take a leaf out of the book of Chinese manufacturers of cheap phones. The latter all use Android now, so why don&amp;rsquo;t the former all use DD-WRT or OpenWRT?</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;The state of Open Source projects in Ireland vs other countries, based on GitHub activity&amp;rdquo;
Last weekend I was working away on a personal side-project of mine and I suddenly realised I follow almost no Irish projects or developers on GitHub. I then started writing this post which was going to be an attack on our lack of people who work on OSS projects outside of work.
But rather than go with gut, I decided to see if I could back it up with data.</description>

We all know that Picasa Web Albums will be shut down in 2013. Or given a lobotomy and renamed to Google+ Photos.
But desktop Picasa is a decent enough photo management tool that you can use without any reference to Picasa Web or Google+. And Dropbox is fab. However I find the Dropbox photo import mechanism both unreliable and crude. Everything gets dumped into one folder, and that&amp;rsquo;s when it works at all.</description>

It just struck me that Amazon is missing a serious trick with the Kindle here. An RSS-based reader which works on E-ink, Fire, Android and Cloud Reader could be something awesome.</description>

Were living in a new kind of computing environment. Everyone has a device, sometimes multiple devices. Its been a long time since we have had this rate of changeit probably hasnt happened since the birth of personal computing 40 years ago.
To make the most of these opportunities, I need to focus otherwise I spread myself too thin and lack impact. So today I&amp;rsquo;m announcing some more closures, bringing the total to 70 Google features or services closed since my spring cleaning began in 2011:  I first used Google+ in 2011 in an effort to make it easy for me to discover and keep tabs on my favorite topics.</description>

I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist and ordered the necessary ATMega chip plus Xtal from Farnell in Ireland along with the usual cheapo bits from DX in China.</description>

TL;DR - Download the Windows RunKeeper to Endomondo tool.

I&amp;rsquo;ve been using RunKeeper as my main mobile running app since January of last year. I liked it so much, I moved to the paid &amp;ldquo;Elite&amp;rdquo; tier pretty quickly. For almost a year, I really couldn&amp;rsquo;t fault it and liked the social interactions with other Irish users along with its rock solid stability.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m two months using Windows 8 64-bit on my desktop and I&amp;rsquo;m still ok with it. The only real weirdness is a lot of disk churning even when nothing is happening. I turned off indexing but to no avail.
The only major annoyance has been OpenVPN. Whilst it works fine when it&amp;rsquo;s on, the problem arises when I disconnect or shut it down. The routing gets all messed up and I cannot connect to any external site.</description>

Following up from the Cheese After the enormous attention that the Cheese Controlled Car got, my thoughts moved to what else we could use with the i-racer. Two immediately came to mind: the Wiimote and a mousepad. But both went in directions I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect. I&amp;rsquo;ll write up the mousepad at a later stage but this post is about the Wii.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been lucky to-date that I haven&amp;rsquo;t killed the RPi stone dead with my little projects. I find the simplest way to help avoid any catastrophic shorts is to use an old 40-core IDE cable (note, the &amp;ldquo;newer&amp;rdquo; 80-core ones don&amp;rsquo;t work even tho they fit). I Dremeled mine last week to fit in this very nice inexpensive case.

In many ways, that GPIO header on the RPi is like the expansion port on the ZX Spectrum.</description>

When Santa told me that he was getting an i-Racer remote controlled car for Fionn, I was very excited. This is a remote controlled car that, on the surface looks very crude. Heck it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even come with a remote control.

That&amp;rsquo;s because it&amp;rsquo;s Bluetooth-controlled! You can install a simple Android App, pair with the car and control it either with on-screen controls or using the accelerometer in the phone.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;My 4 years of Android today and Ireland&amp;rsquo;s first Android App&amp;rdquo;
Today is the 4th anniversary of me paying $499 on eBay for a HTC G1, the first Android phone. Whilst some of my tech predictions over the years have been a little off (cough iPad) I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have got it more right with Android.
When I heard about the Android project mid-2008, it was obvious Google wasn&amp;rsquo;t going into things half-heartedly.</description>

It manages to capture everything we should do to replace our dumb generic disposable consumer culture.

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Sib\u00e9al&amp;rsquo;s Halloween Eye of Deatttttttttth&amp;rdquo;
Myself and Sibal put together a really simple but effective spooky eye for Halloween recently. It caused great interest in her school during Halloween dress-up day just before mid-term.
It simply consists of an old ping-pong ball with a hole dremeled into it and large bright red LED inserted into the hole. That&amp;rsquo;s connected via a resistor and long wires down her arm to her wrist which has a PP9 battery taped to it.</description>

We had some good fun last night with the neighbourhood kids making use of ourDoorbell of Dooooooooommmmmmmm.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had a bigger doorbell project planned for quite a while but 2 weeks ago decided we should do a simpler Halloween one. Using various bits bought from Sparkfun and Maplin along with a great tutorial from Adafruit (more below), I finally got something we were happy with, working late last week.</description>

Great to see this Meetup happen and big props to Eamon and the crew for hosting.If you are interested in getting involved in OpenData in Ireland please attend. Registration is here but the event is free.
Ireland needs to get beyond talking about OpenData and start increasing the number of people actually Opening Up The Data in a big way. The Irish tech community has to lead by example and that means just doing it.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Google Hangouts Extensions point to a richer Google+ Platform future&amp;rdquo;
Yesterday I read about a delightful project involving LEDs, Arduino, Processing, Node.js, Google+ and Google Hangouts.
I was originally interested due to the Arduino angle but then I realised there was something extremely powerful going on with Google+ Hangouts and had to dig in more.
Have a look at the video first, it&amp;rsquo;s an extremely cool mashing together of a bunch of things.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m really pleased to see this release happen. Dec/Jan was an awkward time as Google dropped App Inventor and MIT didn&amp;rsquo;t have their site ready. MIT has done a sterling job since and it&amp;rsquo;s great to know that the full up-to-date source code is available. I hope a community of contributors to the codebase now starts building up.
One issue we ran into in our school with accessing the main MIT site and GAE was a lack of bandwidth.</description>

Limor &amp;ldquo;Ladyada&amp;rdquo; Fried of Adafruit has put together a really lovely colouring book called E is for Electronics. It has everything from A-is-for-Ampere to Z-is-for-Zener-Diode. You can buy it online for $10 or just print it off using the booklet setting of your printer. I printed one for our 8 y/o daughter and she is a big fan. I&amp;rsquo;ve just done another copy our 7 y/o son.</description>

This post was going to be just an up-to-date summary of many other articles out there on this subject. With the rapid rate of change in the RPi world, even very recent guides have proven to be unusable quite quickly.
However I&amp;rsquo;d first like to remember Mike Singleton who died last week. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know his name until today when I read this lovely piece about him.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Clay Shirky on Git, diffs and Government legislation&amp;rdquo;
The reason I like Clay Shirky&amp;rsquo;s talks so much is because he communicates complex &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; in a way most people can understand.
Here he ties together Git, diffs and Government legislation beautifully. If you are similar with the law but not Git or diffs, it&amp;rsquo;s well worth a watch. And vice versa.

This has been a superb week in Ireland for showing what motivated geeks can do with even the most clunky of Government data. After the Oireachtas XML debacle, it was a joy to see the new Residential Property Price Register site make its data available. Sure, it was poxy old CSV files per year and it wasriddled with errors but I really am pleased with what it triggered.</description>

I just grabbed the three CSV files from the Residential Property Price Register site (why is a Captcha needed for that?). I merged some address columns in Excel and added &amp;ldquo;Ireland&amp;rdquo; to all of the addresses. I then just imported into Google Fusion Tables and told it to Geo-Code the data.</description>

Getting fit and losing weight is a very serious subject. But it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be. All the talk of burn and crunch and walls and plank and core and bootcamps and weigh-ins would put anyone off. No wonder so many people are obese.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading Scott Jurek&amp;rsquo;s book Eat &amp;amp; Run for the past while and it&amp;rsquo;s incredibly inspirational. Not in a happy-clappy sense but in the pure joy of running that leaps off the page.</description>

The first ever OFFSITE event in West Cork yesterday was a big success. I learned a lot from all the other speakers both about technology and business. The real stand-out for me was Ger Keohane&amp;rsquo;s talk on eCommerce conversions. It was pretty stunning how you can seriously improve conversions to actual purchase with some very non-obvious changes.</description>

Actually notdisastrous. The golf club is notlabelledas an airship landing strip for a start. But then I spotted something interesting.
Back about 6 years ago, Google Maps was completely useless in West Cork.</description>

My standing desk experiments have been intermittent but I&amp;rsquo;ve put some renewed effort in recently due to some back twinges. I finally cleared out the tiny annex office off my main office and changed the standing desk over to my main laptop.
Overall it works brilliantly and is more stable than the previous set of cardboard boxes :-) The floor mat is important to avoid getting sore heels.</description>

My ancient old Ford Mondeo (2001) is still going strong. In some ways I hate it for doing so. It&amp;rsquo;s an appliance and I don&amp;rsquo;t like appliances, I like things with character. Prior to it I only bought Citroens (BX, AX, Xantia) and I loved them dearly. But they were unreliable piles of junk assembled by drunks. Then, once we had kids, an appliance became necessary.</description>

If Facebook paid even a minutes notice to the intention graph rather than the social graph, they&amp;rsquo;d see that I relentlessly click Hide on all mentions of games. Then maybe they could avoid wasting their valuable screen real-estate pimping something I will never ever ever click on.
I also had a look at some of the ads on FB today.</description>

I saw this in the control panel for one of my Google Apps for Your Domain accounts today.

The value-add for paid accounts on Google Apps has always been very poor. $50 per user for a few tweaks most people don&amp;rsquo;t need. This could change things, particularly for those who want to use Google+ as a replacement for Yammer.

The first-ever Nerdy Derby will take place at World Maker Faire New York on September 29th and 30th at the New York Hall of Science in Queens.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Sib\u00e9al, Fionn and S\u00edofra use littleBits for the first time&amp;rdquo;
Last night, just before bedtime, I handed over littleBits to our three younger kids. They had never seen or used it before and I wanted to gauge their reaction to it.

Overall they loved it and it was the first thing Fionn looked for when he got up this morning. Sibal also snuk off with it for a while on her own last night after the others had gone to bed.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Comic Sans Will Get You Thrown Off Twitter&amp;rdquo;
I just used the Twitter API to get my recent Tweets. I took one of those tweets and rendered it in Comic Sans:
From now on, this breaks Twitter&amp;rsquo;s Guidelines, Requirements. I know you don&amp;rsquo;t care, but remember, the next time you Tweet, they own it, not you.

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;First Hands-On with littleBits. Yes I&amp;rsquo;m grinning a lot.&amp;rdquo;
The lovely lovely people in Sugru sent me a littleBits kit and a great book yesterday. I have been intrigued by littleBits since I saw discovered it via the Adafruit site a while back. Soon afterwards they raised bunch of money and I was pleased to see Ireland&amp;rsquo;s own PCH involved in the production.
If you are not familiar with littleBits, it&amp;rsquo;s a beautifully simple way of learning about electronics using parts which just snap together using magnets.</description>

There have been lots of concerns about the future of Twitter recently. App.netwas recently announced as a pay-for alternative to Twitter with a powerful API, no ads and a deep commitment to not constantly change the rules on users and developers to suit an ever-changing business plan.
I always find it funny how people believe that the thing they are using now will never be replaced; from smoke to horses to telegrams to Friendster to Twitter.</description>

We launched Google Listen through Google Labs in August 2009, to give people a way to discover and listen to podcasts. However, with Google Play, people now have access to a wider variety of podcast apps, so weve discontinued Listen. I never thought Listen was very good but this cancellation is why more and more I avoid Google&amp;rsquo;s non-core products.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t throw out that standalone phone battery charger&amp;rdquo;
An old hack I had forgotten about.
There is nothing more annoying about phones than upgrading them and finding that your battery is a different size and won&amp;rsquo;t fit in your old charger, even tho the contacts line up. OK, there is one thing more annoying - owning a phone that doesn&amp;rsquo;t let you take the battery out (cough iPhone).
So rather than put the old HTC Desire charger in the bin, I went at it with a Stanley knife and some Sugru.</description>

I have a bunch of blogposts bouncing around in my head which I&amp;rsquo;ll hopefully start writing on my holliers, from Friday. Stuff around the tactile nature of hardware, Makers, having a Masters in Electronics I never really used, low volume production, crowd-sourcing solutions to problems instead of relying on guv&amp;rsquo;ment, moving production back to the first world, education, Kickstarter, doing vs learning etc etc etc.
There are a ton of companies supplying the Maker market and electronics people in general.</description>

You ain&amp;rsquo;t seen a piechart until you&amp;rsquo;ve seen a Spectrum colour-clash pie-chart like that. Of course I didn&amp;rsquo;t even get a mention, let alone win the thing.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve just been to their Blackpool Cork store and their infamous excessive prices still managed to shock me.
In the old days when they might be the only game in town for electornics, they could get away with this messing, but with this internet thingy that we all use now, it&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Using your Media Player, Tablet or Raspberry Pi on a Hotel TV&amp;rdquo;
One thing that has driven me mad for the past several years is hotels making it hard to connect your gear to their TVs. Older TVs are usually easier and have a SCART at the back. LCDs bolted into a wall-unit tend to be the worst.
I usually travel with a media player, a variety of cables and a universal remote control.</description>

When I announced the availablity of Open Data on Google Fusion Tables for the Bandon Flood Early Warning System (FEWS) last year, one suggestion that was made to me by Imogen Bertin was to put it up on Pachube (now renamed to the slightly less obscure Cosm). I gave it a go but couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure it out. Despite providing it with the CSV link to the Fusion Table, it never did anything with the data.</description>

A lovely film for Father&amp;rsquo;s Day from Jane and the Sugru team. It was a real pleasure having Julian, John and Ben visit us in Bandon.
Sibal will be delighted to see her Raspberry Pi Lego case getting a great look in.

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;I think I&amp;rsquo;ve found the ultimate alarm clock project&amp;rdquo;
As part of the kids and I playing around with Arduino, Sibal thought that we should try and find an alarm clock project for her to build. I&amp;rsquo;ve found some amazing ones with features like Vacuum Flourescent Tubes but they are a very pricey and the mechanical learning ones on Amazon don&amp;rsquo;t really keep time
Then today I found this, The Acoustic Alarm.</description>

Fan-bloody-tastic idea. My only disappointment is that you are not controlling real robotic squishy frogs but I guess that would be illegal. And a bit too close to Ender&amp;rsquo;s Game.

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Two tutorials later and the kids are liking the Arduino a lot&amp;rdquo;
I sat down with 8 y/o daughter and 10 y/o son this afternoon to try out our ARDX starter kit for Arduino. The first tutorial is a simple single LED which you flash on/off in software. But I was horrified to find myself stumped!

Yes, I may have a Masters in Electronic Engineering from UCD but, as anyone who did Electronics there prior to the mid-90s knows, a certain lecturer ensured that we all left completely clueless in basic circuit cop-on.</description>

Been slammed with work for two weeks (will never complain about that!) which means blogging has been a bit light. But the big excitement yesterday was my ARDX Arduino Starter Kit arriving from Seeedstudio.

If you are not familair with Arduino, it is an OpenSource hardware platform forelectronicsprojects, tinkering, robotics, home automation etc etc etc. The blue board above is the heart of it.</description>

6 days ago, I posted this on Google+

The response from a Googler was that &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything new to share right now&amp;rdquo;. The following day, Scoble stated that he had heard they will announce a Write-API at Google IO.
Instead, they make the blindingly obvious step of merging Places with Google+ Pages to make Plus Local. A totally sensible move.</description>

My mother isn&amp;rsquo;t obviously technical but she is incredibly practical. This is a woman, who at the age of 12, was sent to live with her widowed Grandfather, to take care of him! Nothing fazes her.
As she lives in Kilkenny, she always found the Sugru story interesting (Jane, the inventor, is from Kilk) and bought a packet to see what it was about.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Lego Case and Sugru for Raspberry Pi&amp;rdquo;

My 8 y/o daughter and I put together this Lego case for Raspberry Pi. All design concepts are hers and she built it. My job was to make it all fit and not wobble. Which of course we did using Sugru.

The case is a lot bigger than the RPi but that gives us expansion opportunities for USB hubs and battery packs.</description>

I asked my 8 y/o daughter on Monday if there was anything she didn&amp;rsquo;t like about her 88 Tablet after a week of ownership. I assumed she&amp;rsquo;d gripe about the touch sensitivity of the screen, which I still see as a problem. Nope, she had a single criticism - the battery only lasts a couple of hours on a charge.</description>

I have been driven demented by Google&amp;rsquo;s multi-login feature since it launched. Every damned tool of theirs seems to do it differently. The good ones let you flick seamlessly between accounts (Google+). The awful ones won&amp;rsquo;t let you select an alternative (yes you Picasa Web) and if you logout, you logout of everything. And of course, they always default to the one you don&amp;rsquo;t want (hellooo Google Reader).</description>

There are three basic user parts to App Inventor. The browser-based Designer, the Java-based Blocks Editor and the Phone Emulator (if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a phone).</description>

Yes I know it&amp;rsquo;s a stupid thing to want to do but dammit, if it&amp;rsquo;s technically possible, we should at least try.
One of the most annoying things about the HTC Sensation is how HTC has hamstrung it with a brain-dead Bluetooth stack instead of the one provided by the chipset provider. This means it cannot do the HID profile to support keyboards, mice and Wiimotes.</description>

A few years back, quite a few of us put effort into building our family tree on Geni. For a while I was a fan. Then someone connected two big trees via marriage and it has been a disaster ofirrelevant birthday notifications about people I have never heard of since.
Also, the constant upsells mean I haven&amp;rsquo;t logged in for a very long time except to check the odd birthday.</description>

Yesterday I finally got both MHL to the TV and Bluetooth to the Wiimote working with a ZX Spectrum Emulator on my HTC Sensation (video coming over the weeked). I was amused by the fact that I was emulating a cheap old computer with an expensive mobile phone.

Then I wondered - How cheap was the Spectrum compared to the Sensation? Some googling for inflation adjusters later and I realised I was completely wrong.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;End of an Era - Philips switches off TV production&amp;rdquo;
Whilst this story passed by mainly unnoticed, I was very sad to hear that Philips is exiting the TV business. I have a lot of wonderful memories of working with the TV guys in Eindhoven and it pains me to see everything move to a JV in China.

My first degree-related summer-job in college in 1989 was in Eindhoven. My Dad knew a Dutch businessman who had connections in Philips and he got me a job in the Overseas TV department.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;XBMC running on Raspberry Pi. I may faint with the anticipation&amp;rdquo;
The kids&amp;rsquo; non-360 XBOX running XBMC has been an amazing piece of kit. We&amp;rsquo;ve had it for over 4 years and got it second-hand for approx 60 but it maxes out at 480p content. I had thought that getting a replacement like the Patriot or WD Live TV would cost north of 80. But some geniuses have got XBMC running on the Raspberry Pi.</description>

As we all patiently wait for the Raspberry Pi boards to arrive, one smart individual has built a full VM so you can try out the software in Virtualbox on your PC. I&amp;rsquo;m downloading now and will report back on whether it runs on VMware Workstation and Player too. There are a few things I want to try out on Raspberry Pi and this setup will let me confirm whether they are feasible or not in advance.</description>

So far I really love the Fuji Finepix 4200 bridge camera. Barely scratched the surface of it but it&amp;rsquo;s like being in a different century to our old point n shoots.
One obvious drawback of a non-cameraphone is that you lose Instant Upload to the web. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a kerfuffle to remove the SD Card, power up a laptop and then upload.</description>

Two completely separate stories joined together nicely this morning.
First was the news that Mario Kart 64 now runs on Android. I initially thought [a] it&amp;rsquo;s an official port and [b] therefore it&amp;rsquo;s an April fool. But I installed and ran it perfectly on a HTC Sensation running ICS.

Then I got an email from MP4 Nation in Hong Kong offering their Herotab C8 Android Tablet for $89.</description>

One of the niche problems with the iPhone 4 is full-length marathons. If you, like my wife, run 26 miles with music playing and Runkeeper recording all your stats, you will get to mile 25 and the battery will run out. Annoying to say the least.
I have tried a few el-cheapo chinese add-on battery packs that plug into the bottom but they rarely last more than a few weeks before going kaput.</description>

They come up for renewal on April 19th for $20 for the pair with GoDaddy. Nameservers and hosting are with Blacknight.
I won&amp;rsquo;t be renewing.

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Lego should partner with Raspberry Pi and App Inventor&amp;rdquo;
I&amp;rsquo;ve written before about how Lego Mindstorms is ridiculously overpriced. Whilst the intent was probably good, it is so far from the brilliance of cheap educational plastic blocks that they need to start again.
I love the idea of building robotics kits and teaching kids about basic programming in the process. In theory I&amp;rsquo;m also a big fan of MIT App Inventor having Mindstorms integration but the problem is price.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;I never knew reCAPTCHA was used to help digitize old books&amp;rdquo;
Yesterday on Twitter I jokingly suggested that Facebook&amp;rsquo;s CAPTCHA had a &amp;ldquo;sure that&amp;rsquo;s close enough&amp;rdquo; setting since there was no way I&amp;rsquo;d guessed the second word correctly. Then two people pointed out that the second word was optional. I was gobsmacked. Years of hitting refresh until I got a word I could read, followed by the stress of guesssing, wasted!</description>

What a seriously great idea from @Elana.
Whether your kids go to Code Ninja; Coder Dojo; a club in their school; or the Munster Programming Training in UCC, they should be looking at Raspberry Pi.
What the heck is Raspberry Pi?

We use GIMP for all of our basic bitmap manipulations. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s changing the colour of stars or modifying logos for Facebook Connect, it gets the job done brilliantly. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried many others like Paint.net and nothing comes close. But as anyone who has used it knows, they have had that horrible multi-window setup for years.
I went looking earlier to see if there had been any progress on GIMP in general.</description>

I suddenly realised two weeks ago that I was probably due a phone upgrade on Vodafone. They kindly gave me a HTC Sensation as a prize in a competition last year so I hadn&amp;rsquo;t bothered think about it.
But for fun I decided to have a look at what was available.
Whilst the screen on the Galaxy Nexus is lovely, it seems a strange &amp;ldquo;flagship&amp;rdquo; with only a 5MP camera and no SD card slot.</description>

Why carry two devices, when you could carry only one? Your next high-end smartphone has far more horsepower than youll need on a phone, and more than enough for a laptop. So weve brought Android together with Ubuntu, the worlds favourite free operating system, to give you a full productivity desktop that fits in your pocket. Android for the phone experience, Ubuntu for the desktop, all on one device, running at the same time.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;XBMC + Windows Media Center make surprisingly great bedfellows&amp;rdquo;
Our main TV PC spends most of its time running the awesome XBMC software. It has everything you need in a media player except one - recording. Whilst there are forks of it out there which work with the MythTV or Media Portal recording software, I&amp;rsquo;ve never had much success configuring either reliably.
As I mentioned before, I accidentally discovered late last year that Windows Media Center is fantastic at handling TV.</description>

I love VLC. It&amp;rsquo;s a media player than can handle any piece of crap video you throw at it. When WMP can&amp;rsquo;t keep audio/video in sync for more than a minute, VLC nails it. There is an incredible set of features in there, of which I have only barely scratched the surface.
But, and it&amp;rsquo;s a big but, the UI was designed by a blind person.</description>

Ah this is just lovely. As anyone who listens to Kermode and Mayo&amp;rsquo;s film reviews on BBC Radio 5 Live (mostly via podcast) knows, they say hello to Jason Isaacs almost every week.
It has become a bit of a meme with people trying to do the same via ever more interesting ways, including the rolling credits on the spoof news on the Jay Leno show.</description>

For me, in my innocence, the arrival of Netflix over here represented far more than justanothersource of media at a good price. I hoped it was the beginning of the end for the nonsensical region-limiting of media based on pre-internet, pre-airplane, business models.
All of the vested interests can fight all they like, but eventually every movie, song and TV show will be available in every format at the same time globally.</description>

The Verge is reporting that the Roku LT and Roku 2 XS are now shipping in UK and Ireland. They both come with Netflix and BBC iPlayer support. (Oddly their UK site still says &amp;ldquo;Coming Soon&amp;rdquo; for the LT).
The LT is particularly interesting as it is only 49despite the lack of wired Ethernet or 1080p.But both models suffer the major and strange limitation that they cannot stream your home content, even over UPNP.</description>

How much better would social search be if Google surfaced results from all across the web? The results speak for themselves. We created a tool that uses Googles own relevance measurethe ranking of their organic search resultsto determine what social content should appear in the areas where Google+ results are currently hardcoded.
All of the information in this demo comes from Google itself, and all of the ranking decisions are made by Google&amp;rsquo;s own algorithms.</description>

I saw a bunch of mentions of IFTTT a few months back but didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to try it out.

Thrilled to see that thecode is now available for anyone to grab and modify. Once MIT is up and running well, they&amp;rsquo;ll start accepting contributions.
My challenge to all the developers out there - port all of AppInventor to iOS. This would be far far more important and valuable for a child&amp;rsquo;s education than some overpriced e-Books on a single vendor platform.

A few minutes ago, Google shut down Jaiku, just after I posted a #goodbye.

My last proper post there was 3 years and 5 months ago. For a short period in 2007, many thought it would overtake Twitter during the relentless fail-whale era, but it never got the traction.

I always said everything could have been different if Google had made it the Social Address Book in Android back in 2008.</description>

In response to many complaints from users of the iPad 2 that the 8finger-2thumb gesture to switch between Apps was too simplistic, we can exclusively reveal that Apple will shortly announce their Multi-Toe Interface.
Recent research has shown that 82% of iPad usage is on the sofa in front of the TV. Apple further discovered that over 73% of people watch TV with their shoes off.</description>

I blogged about this before ages ago but had some recent questions on it so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do a quick update. If, like me, you drive an old car, your car stereo probably doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an audio jack and almost definitely doesn&amp;rsquo;t have bluetooth.
If you have a Ford from 1999 onwards then you have the added problem of a double height stereo whose CD player is probably knackered at this stage.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a Rusty Hoodie with, wait for it, built-in machine-washable headphones!

There is a separate pocket for your phone/MP3-player and a headphone plug in there. It runs up to the in-ear headphones which are actually the toggles at the end of the hood draw-string.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s been over 36 hours and I haven&amp;rsquo;t blogged about Netflix launching on this side of the pond yet. Twitter was non-stop about it yesterday and rightly so. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen every extreme of opinion expressed there so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d lash down a few thoughts and findings.
We are probably the perfect target demographic for Netflix. We cut the cord on Sky back in September after we got sick of paying for a pile of old crap we never watched.</description>

If you are not familiar with App Inventor, it is a way of building mobile phone applications for Google Android phones using a simple graphical blocks approach.</description>

The Google App Engine bit is absolutely trivial. Full MIT documentation is here.  Go to appengine.google.com and sign-up with a GMail/GApps address. Create an App. This only means giving the App an name.</description>

I predict they will either shut up shop before this time next year or be sold for chump change by their VCs. Rumours that they are already hawking themselves around to CE companies sound reasonable.
Boxee got all of its buzz and online promotion from early adopters like me who loved their fork of the XBMC code-base.</description>

I&#39;d love to see kits for London Eye, Empire State, Golden Gate, Olympics 2012 etc that would appeal to boys and girls.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t Forget to Download Your App Inventor Projects - Shutdown on Dec 31st&amp;rdquo;
If you ever did anything on GoogleApp Inventor, you have 9 days to download your code.I had to log in 30 times to download all the projects of the kids in our school (30 teams of 2). Next step is to setup a private instance of App Inventor on App Engine and EC2 in lieu of MIT being ready.</description>

via coreh.github.com I like the Cloud 9 IDE but it isn&#39;t integrated into my workflow. nide, OTOH, is installed on my servers. On first try, I love it already. Editing code in the browser is so much easier than using console Emacs/VIM or SFTP remotely. It looks like they have tied Git support in too. They need to add some sort of simple access control soon and I&#39;ll be a complete convert.</description>

Ask many people of a certain age (around 40) where they first encountered a computer and you will invariably hear &amp;ldquo;Tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s World in the Grafton Arcade&amp;rdquo;. Yet strangely if you google it, most of the mentions online are by me since 2005.
I can&amp;rsquo;t overstate how important that shop was for several years in the 1980s. Just like the first McDonald&amp;rsquo;s on Grafton Street was a Mecca for us muckers up for our Christmas shopping in the 80s, so too was Tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s World for anyone who knew what a home computer was.</description>

What&amp;rsquo;s marvellous about it is that both of them seem to initially be in opposition to each other but both have extremely relevant points to make and refine their arguments.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;MongoPress - A MongoDB-based CMS inspired by WordPress&amp;rdquo;
These guys started out building a plugin for WordPress to make it use MongoDB instead of MySQL but found it was almost impossible. So they decided to build an alternative called MongoPress based on many of the good things about WordPress and hopefully none of the bad things (Die-WordPress-Editor-Die-Die-Die).It&amp;#39;s early days but it looks interesting so far. I&amp;#39;ll play around over Christmas and see how it scales.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve got to hand it to Google, ICS is an absolute pleasure to use. Everything feels integrated and consistent and beautiful. It&amp;rsquo;s really interesting how much of a difference even a font change can make.
I just played around with an early community Alpha firmware of it for the HTC Sensation and even at this buggy stage, I want to switch. The iPad2 I&amp;rsquo;ve been using for the past 10 days feels like a clunky locked-down VTech toy in comparison.</description>

  Earlier in the week I got annoyed at Facebook for changing yet another API for no good reason (oh let&amp;#39;s change blah_blah to blahBlah from now on, just for kicks). I&amp;#39;ve come to the realisation that they are breaking the web bit by bit. A site you built in 1997 willprobablybe 100% functional in 2011. A site you built in 2010 with deep Facebook integration, will probably be 90% broken in 2012 if you are notmaintainingit daily.</description>

Wayyyy back in Feb 2008, the iGo Stowaway keyboard was being end-of-lined due to its non-HID compatibility and I managed to snare one for &amp;pound;18 in the UK. It had previously been north of &amp;pound;100.
It&amp;rsquo;s one of the best purchases I&amp;rsquo;ve ever made. Over the years I have used it with a Nokia N770 tablet, an N95-8GB phone, a HTC Desire, Boxee/XBMC on our TV PC and now, drum-roll, hurrah, it works on the iPad2 too!</description>

Today, we are announcing that we will remove all App Profile Pages on February 1st, 2012. Though similar in appearance, the automatically generated App Profile Pages differ in features from traditional Facebook Pages, and over time the inconsistencies between the two, such as different Insights, APIs, and distribution channels, have become more apparent.
via developers.facebook.com If you have an App that you add to Pages as a Tab by sending Page Owners to the App&#39;s own Profile Page, then you need to change how you do things.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Ois\u00edn, aged 9, may have just invented the next generation of treadmill&amp;rdquo;
We were watching Modern Family last night and the subject of running/fitness came up for some reason. My wife and I are doing the Amsterdam Marathon (Half in my case) and Oisn had the genius idea that treadmills should be able to imitate any route by changing the incline as you run. Then he suggested showing a map too.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;My Latest Work of Sugru Genius&amp;rdquo;
I&amp;#39;m a big fan of Lidl keyboards and mice. They are now just as reliable as anything Microsoft or Logitech does and much cheaper. However whilst their wireless receivers have been getting smaller and smaller over the years they have also been getting more and more fragile. One of them shattered completely on me recently so of course I reached for the Sugru. In my enthusiasm to create something with a bit of character, I forgot that it was supposed to sit inside the mouse when travelling.</description>

I was just bitching on Facebook about the recent changes and one of the FB guys mentioned that he has seen the original Harvard version of it. I suddenly realised we need some way of capturing the activity and behaviour of important web-apps over time. We all remember the cultural terrorism of Carol Bartz in Yahoo shutting down GeoCities.</description>

  Top story in my stream right now according to Facebook? Robin Wauters picture of a beer bottle as he watches TV.&amp;nbsp;
Yep,&amp;nbsp;critical&amp;nbsp;breaking news according to Facebook&amp;rsquo;s Cletus. As I just said on Facebook: 
The reason newspapers are dying is because people don&amp;rsquo;t want others picking old news for them&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;..so Facebook decides it wants to pick old news for me.&amp;nbsp;This isn&amp;rsquo;t a &amp;ldquo;ooh I don&amp;rsquo;t like the layout&amp;rdquo; complaint, this is fundamental to users being in control of what they see on the internet.</description>

I normally don&amp;#39;t get overwrought about Facebook changes as they rarely affect me much. e.g. the Subscribe thing is a poor imitation of Twitter so I simply don&amp;#39;t use it.But removing the option to show all stories chronologically?That&amp;#39;s just not on! I called Facebook peak at 21m users. Never one to learn from my mistakes, I&amp;#39;m calling it again at 750m users, or whatever they were are at three weeks ago.</description>

  It&amp;#39;s been three weeks since I won a HTC Sensation in some Vodafone Ireland competition I don&amp;#39;t remember entering. Thanks Vodafone! I thought I&amp;#39;d do a quick update about it.
Overall? Fabulous! Seriously, it&amp;#39;s an awesome phone. If you don&amp;#39;t drink the Steve kool-aid (hell, even if you do), this is the joint best phone on the market (along with the Samsung Galaxy S II).</description>

First the wee project. In October I&amp;#39;mkickingoff a small pilot in my kids&amp;#39; Primary School. I&amp;#39;ll be &amp;quot;teaching&amp;quot; App Inventor for 30 mins a week to each of 5th and 6th class. The idea is to run it to Christmas and then pause/review to see if it&amp;#39;s worth continuing and expanding. Our Parents&amp;#39;Association and the relevant teachers and Head are fully behind it.</description>

Yesterday I read rumours of early winter snow in Ireland. We&amp;#39;ve had a couple of winters of either &amp;quot;surprising&amp;quot; snow or horrible floods in Bandon. It&amp;#39;s time to embrace my inner mucker and buy a proper farmer-style SUV. I&amp;#39;m not talking silly frou-frou soccer-mom pretend-off-roaders, I want something that can go up a vertical cliff in low gear and do 4000 mpg on diesel.</description>

I gave up on Yahoo a long long time ago. The ultimate bungee VP company that came up with so many great products and ideas but followed through on almost none of them. I wouldn&amp;#39;t touch any new Yahoo web-app with a long shitty stick because I know it&amp;#39;ll be canned 12 months later. The death of Yahoo Maps, once the absolute industry leader, is a case study in how Yahoo screws up.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Our replacement for Sky TV cost \u008099. Ariva 120. No monthly fees!&amp;rdquo;
So the kids complained about the removal of Sky. A lot. There are only so many Charlie and Lola episodes you can watch on YouTube, particularly the ones in Finnish. The intention was to get that very highly recommended Humax Freesat box on Amazon but it&amp;#39;s bloody pricey and we weren&amp;#39;t sure we needed all of the features. Then the very kind @gpelly on Twitter mentioned the hugely impressive Ferguson Ariva 120 Combo.</description>

After our ongoing argument over the telephone connection with Sky TV, they doubled the multi-room charge, so we cancelled the lot in early August.Today the cancellation finally kicked in.The kids are in shock. We had planned to get a Freesat box but we&amp;#39;re actually going to play it by ear and get nothing for a while. Let&amp;#39;s see how they survive on the few stations they can get in &amp;quot;Other Channels&amp;quot; on the Sky box, along with BBC iPlayer, Hulu and YouTube.</description>

Sibal, our 7 y/o, just read a sample chapter of Judy Moody on my Kindle. Some of the words were beyond her and we made good use of the dictionary feature which is pretty decent.
But it struck me that a &amp;quot;Kid Mode&amp;quot; would be 100x more useful. It would give a child-friendly pop-up explanation plus optional audio pronounciation. Basically what the VTech Storio does but at Amazon scale.</description>

  Today is the 20th anniversary of the web. Pretty incredible 20 years really. My own history of the internet was finding Usenet in 1990 when I started my Masters in UCD, followed by email, FTP.FUNET.FI, Gopher, WAIS and the joy of downloadable shareware. There was then a pause from 92-94 as I worked on GSM basestation software in S3 and only had email.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Nintendo&amp;rsquo;s Penny Pinching Bites Them In The Ass&amp;rdquo;
 
via isuppli.com Nintendo has made a lot of money out of us over the years. All of our kids have been DS and Wii fanatics.
Sadly I knew the 3DS would be a flop when it was the first product they announced where the same kids showed zero interest. Some vague recognition that 3D might be cool but that&#39;s it.</description>

Is it just us or does it feel a little bit magic?

Currently in Ireland 650 people are awaiting transplantation. This will only happen if suitable organ donors are found for them. Transplantation is entirely reliant on the publics willingness to donate organs. Your next-of-kin are more likely to carry out your wish to donate your organs after your death, if they have had a conversation with you, or they can see evidence of your wish somewhere.</description>

We run all of our business phone comms on Blueface (Irish number), Skype (UK number) and Google Voice (US Number). I was doing some checking on dial-out pricing on those services and others over the weekend and collected this initial pricing comparison. Thought it might be useful. Note that these are all Pay As You Go prices, except Eircom which is the home Talktime Chatter package.</description>

If you are not familiar with it, it&amp;rsquo;s a platform for building iPhone/Android/Blackberry/WP7/Nokia-WRT mobile applications from one code-base using just HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are not just web-apps, they can be uploaded to the various App Stores too.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;So I got a new laptop. That&amp;rsquo;s probably the last time I&amp;rsquo;ll ever mention it&amp;rdquo;
Laptops for me are like desktops, phones and screwdrivers. They are tools, not an expression of who I am as a person or what lifestyle I aspire to. I got my last proper one four years ago. It&amp;#39;s still going strong and still as dog slow as the day I bought it, second-hand, on eBay. It was a Dell D420 which I have been juggling with a 120 quid Acer Netbook for the past few years.</description>

  Pretty much every time I bring up Skype, I get one of these massive overlay ads. This is despite me saying I don&amp;#39;t want to see ads and, more importantly, the fact that I&amp;#39;m a paying customer. This is customer abuse, plain and simple.
Luckily I found a solution on one of the Skype forums.In Skype, go to Tools &amp;gt; Change Language &amp;gt; Edit Skype Language File&amp;hellip; &amp;gt; Save as&amp;hellip;Save default English as &amp;quot;SkypeEnglish.</description>

My Skype says 26m people connected right now.Skype says that 300m video chat minutes are used every month.So 10m minutes a day.So 7,000 people every minute out of the 26m connected. i.e. a maximum of 3,500 chats.Sounds about right. i.e. bugger all. What is this bubble obsession with video chat apart from small kids and their parents/grand-parents when they are away?</description>

  Last night I did a clean install of Ubuntu 11.04 in VMware Player on my Windows 7 machine. I love the Easy-Install feature which makes this an unattended piece of cake. But I was perplexed to find that the new Ubuntu Unity Desktop was missing. Eventually I sussed that it doesn&amp;#39;t work (yet) in Player. But in my search I kept finding references to another &amp;quot;Unity&amp;quot; in VMware so I had to see what it was.</description>

You are all probably as sick as I am of all the stuff written about Google+. But I&amp;rsquo;ve found very few posts digging into the functionality beyond the usual top-level feature list. I&amp;rsquo;m really pleased that Google is actively soliciting feedback after their ostrich-like behaviour with Buzz. But there is too much here for me to enter as individual tickets.
Overall
Overall I like Google+ and think I&amp;rsquo;ll be using it quite a bit.</description>

Only issues I&amp;rsquo;ve run into so far are Wifi giving a bit of grief (LAN fine) and some text entry playing silly buggers.</description>

I wrote this piece last year:Google Health + Android + CardioTrainer has me excitedCoincidentally, Erick Schonfeldover on TechCrunch,interviewedthe creator of Google Health, Adam Bosworth, a few weeks back. He said that the reason it never took off was that Google Health never asked, What could they do that people would want?</description>

I did a bit of messing this week on Turntable.fm followed by Google Music on my phone and I&amp;#39;ve been doing some mulling.Google Music has been uploading my music collection to the cloud for a week. Probably another week to go. The genius bit is that the new music player on Android then shows all of your music. If a song is not on your phone and you try to play it, it&amp;#39;ll start streaming it.</description>

I was mulling this morning over the silly post I did yesterday on Stephen Colbert. In my ideal world, the TV show regional-licensing nonsense would go away and consumers in Europe would pay the US producers directly for each show (and vice versa for US consumers). If I want to watch Colbert right now, I want to flip 50c to the show&amp;rsquo;s owners no matter where I am in the world.</description>

The cost of schoolbooks remains an enormous problem for a lot of people. If you have more than one child, you can rarely do hand-me-downs, particularly in Secondary School. The publishers relentlessly issue new versions that are different enough to make it impossible to have multiple editions in one classroom.Given that Maths, History, English, Irish, Physics etc, don&amp;#39;t actually change much except with curriculum changes, does it not make sense for community-minded Irish educators to work together and generate Creative Commons versions of books?</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Boxee fanatic since I first installed it over two years ago. We had been running XBMC on several old XBOXes (and still do) but they couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle x.264 video or HDMI so when I built a media PC, I used Boxee. I am absolutely convinced their focus on social is the right way to go. Social watching of TV in 2011 is barely scratching the surface of what&amp;rsquo;s possible.</description>

We&amp;#39;ve recently started using a new milkman after a many year gap and I&amp;#39;ve been thinking a lot about him. Back in the late 80s and early 90s, the co-ops/creameries basically shut down the in-house milkmen and many of them became independent businesses. I had thought it would be a slow inexorable death for them because of price-competition from the big supermarkets. We stopped using the one in Kimmage in the mid-90s because our milk demands were so variable and he only delivered on certain days.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;The Happy Foot Co is feeding my #VFFs Addiction&amp;rdquo;
It&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous I know. I average one pair of new footwear every two years. I wear shoes until they fall apart and then I buy one more pair. That&amp;rsquo;s now utterly changed.
I bought my Vibram Five Fingers Bikilas exactly one month ago. Running on a treadmill with them is genuinely like having new legs. Unfortunately, like a fool, I ran on the road only two weeks in and I&amp;rsquo;m still suffering with a pain in one foot.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;@Eircom, @VodafoneIreland and others need Twitter Status Accounts&amp;rdquo;
I find that the @eircom account on Twitter is generally extremely responsive and is the fastest way to get an answer to questions. @VodafoneIreland is very good too. However, they both (and O2, Meteor, emobile etc) need to implement status accounts, either a global one each or regional ones. So rather than tons of people badgering them about outages (in particular), we can go to the status account and see what&amp;#39;s going on.</description>

Amazon on Android is a bad joke if you live outside of the US. Apart from a UK specific MP3 store, you are screwed everywhere else.

I blogged recently about the pain of upgrading a machine from XP to Win 7 due to the dreaded Sage. So I&amp;#39;ve continued to hold off. But I just had a total brainwave for a potential solution and it looks like it is possible. I thought &amp;quot;what if I could snapshot the XP install some way using VMWare or VirtualBox?</description>

via data.gov.uk Short but great video of David Cameron on transparency and the right of people in the UK to Government data.

If so, by who? Not a snark, I genuinely want to know.</description>

 via androidcommunity.com I&amp;rsquo;ve said it before and I&amp;rsquo;ll say it again, Android is the ZX Spectrum and BBC Micro of this generation. Google AppInventor nails it on the software side. Now check this out: A USB breakout board with software to control it. Think of the cool things you could build! Oooooh just had a thought. Google should buy MindStorms off Lego, integrate this IOIO, drop the price to $30 and send to schools everywhere along with AppInventor and a few dev phones.</description>

It&amp;#39;s an absolutely superb idea and one that could seriously challenge Twitter&amp;#39;s dominance of live TV watching.I would also be thrilled to see Late Late Show Friday and Sports Saturday disappear off to dedicated pages on Facebook instead of cluttering up my Twitter stream. The story is a little confused between Events and Places.</description>

The Amazon Appstore launched recently and it&amp;rsquo;s very cool, but unfortunately it&amp;rsquo;s limited to US customers, leaving the rest of us out in the cold. Which sucks. BUT, there are ways around it! Successfully using the Appstore relies on you having a US presence - a US credit card, a US address and a US phone number (handily, not a US IP), but there are ways to meet this criteria.</description>

I think Facebook may have a big bug on their hands. I just Liked the Obama computer video on Gawker. It&amp;#39;s showing up in my stream. But it is also showing up as Liked by my wife who is on the same router. She never clicked Like on it.So either there is some IP address NAT weirdness going on with Facebook or there is a screw-up related to cookie somewhere on this notebook from months back, which would be the last time she used this computer.</description>

I was looking at it today to see if it had Helpdesk functionality and found that it did. But Zoho also has a separate app called Creator Helpdek so I needed to figure out which one to use.</description>

It handles most video formats (unlike Apple TV and many phones which only handle MP4), is small, has HDMI-out and Composite out, plays 1080p, takes an internal HDD, has ethernet, USB, optional wifi and a remote. Overall it&#39;s been a great purchase except for a few things.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Very cool, Inkscape can import a PDF so you can edit it&amp;rdquo;
  A constant problem in dealing with design agencies and others is that most of them only deliver the print-ready or web-ready files (PDFs, JPGs etc) and don&amp;#39;t give you the original source PSD, AI, SVG etc. This means that you always have to go back to them, even for the smallest tweak. We have an old flyer from a trade show last year and I want to do a quick re-spin for the lowest cost possible for a trade show next week.</description>

  I&amp;#39;m not so sure it&amp;#39;s supposed to scale like that. Would Honeycomb scale it any differently/better or is the issue AppInventor? That Archos 101 is running Froyo. </description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;The Utter Imbecilic Brain-dead Stupidity of the Amazon App Store for Android&amp;rdquo;
We Irish Android early adopters railed against Google for their slowness in making paid Apps available outside of a tiny group of countries. Finally last year Google got their act together and we&amp;rsquo;re all now good buddies again. No more 3UK SIM tricks for me (except for Flixster, strangely). 
Amazon has just announced their own App Store for Android.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Has the Horror of upgrading Windows on your Sage machine improved?&amp;rdquo;
One of our admin machines is stuck on XP for a very good reason - Sage Instant Accounts. It&amp;#39;s a piece of software we truly detest but we started using it in 2004 and moving to another solution has never looked easy. Also none of those solutions looked much better.In an ideal world, Sage (or a competitor) would figure out SaaS properly, give us one-click import of 7 years of data into a cloud-based solution and work seamlessly from then on with local Irish accountants, Irish VAT etc etc.</description>

Youngfella&amp;#39;s confirmation money is burning a hole in his pocket. After a short-lived diversion towards getting a Tablet, he is now back in the market for a laptop. He currently uses my ancient Acer Aspire with a lines of dead pixels running down the middle of the screen and buttons missing from the keyboard. Given that his main activity is editing his card-trick videos, Netbooks were immediately cast aside.</description>

via doubletwist.com I&#39;ve been pretty lucky with the SD card in my HTC Desire. Despite being hammered constantly due to all apps being installed on an EXT3 partition, the main FAT32 partition has never lost any data. Until today.
The whole thing went bang and everything disappeared (the EXT3 partition was fine). For most of my stuff it&#39;s no big deal, I sync it all out to the cloud.</description>

 We&amp;rsquo;ve had some choice quotes from him today:

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Google AppInventor for Android is a Massive Hit with 11 y/o Son&amp;rdquo;
When Google AppInventor launched I was really excited and signed up for the pre-release immediately. The idea of a drag n drop application creator for Android that was kid-friendly sounded fantastic. Of course all I did was start it up and play for 10 minutes before forgetting about it and ADHDing over to the next cool thing.
Then a few months back I came up with an idea for an Android App which would pull info from a specific RSS feed and do something useful with it.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Monitoring EC2 Servers with Zabbix&amp;rdquo;
Amazon Cloudfront is great for monitoring EC2 servers but it can only do external monitoring so it cannot see things like memory being exhausted etc. I tried using Cacti but it was a nightmare to configure with plugins. Nagios always looks like it&amp;rsquo;d take weeks to sort out. A bit of Googling found Zabbix and people seem to like it. Install was a doddle but configuring can be a pain unless you just copy the demo settings.</description>

Of course it didn&amp;rsquo;t bloody work. When I tried to Sign-in, it said &amp;ldquo;The feature you requested is currently unavailable. Please try again later.&amp;rdquo;. I assume due to the usual Google Apps Accounts vs Normal Google Accounts messing that seems to have got worse rather than better since they &amp;ldquo;upgraded&amp;rdquo; the abilities of Goog Apps Accounts.</description>

I still prefer the Wii tho :-) Surprisingly it comes with a LAN connector rather than Wifi. The official Wifi adapter is 43 on Amazon.co.uk. i.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;How to get a US Phone Number for your Irish Business for Free&amp;rdquo;
I was reminded of our phone setup yesterday when asked how we have implemented our US number. The easiest way is obviously to pay Blueface VOIP or Skype for a US number. But you can actually do it for zero cost which is how we have done it.
The basic setup is as follows:
 Google Voice US number (We chose a Palo Alto area code, cos, wellllll, cos) That GV number is forwarded to a free IPKall Washington State VOIP number (GV will only forward to US number and the old Gizmo tricks don&amp;rsquo;t seem to work since Google bought them) That IPKall number forwarded for free via SIP to our Irish Blueface number  If you get a PAYG account with Blueface then none of the above costs you anything for inbound calls.</description>

Now they are offering 75 and it&amp;#39;s a nice plastic card. I&amp;#39;d love to know how much money is spent on this vs the resulting new revenue. Possible alternatives I can think of are: Send them to every startup incubation centre in Irelandto hand out to start-upsSend them to Enterprise Ireland to hand out to start-upsSend them to the County Enterprise Boardsto hand out to start-ups Send them to every tech course in colleges around the country to give to studentsSend them to every OpenCoffee in IrelandSend them to every Chamber of CommerceSponsor a BarCamp and send a few hundred of them down Sponsor a BizCamp and send a few hundred of them downAny other ones you can think of?</description>

Wow, it looks like I was the only person on the planet to write anything nice about Nokia moving to Windows Phone 7. One point I did make was that they have to move fast. A phone by the summer really is a necessity. But Nokia&amp;rsquo;s problems in recent years have always seemed to boil down to execution. Strategy by the bucket-full but bugger-all follow-through.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ll leave all the industry analysis to the experts and insta-experts on Twitter. I&amp;rsquo;m just looking at the Nokia and Microsoft deal from the perspective of a punter and someone who might consider getting apps built for Nokia+WP7.
So as a punter I liked the look of Windows Phone 7 and I love the industrial design of the Nokia N8. I&amp;rsquo;m also sick to death of the shitty cameras that HTC, Samsung et all are putting in their Android phones.</description>

I normally wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call a result a few days after a new release but bloody hell, Facebook Places has gone mental in Ireland in less than a week. And I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about geeks. Most of the people I am friends with on Facebook have never heard of Foursquare or Gowalla and yet they are checking in all over the place on FB. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing to watch.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;My 368 Days of Posterous - The Stats&amp;rdquo;
Hard to believe it&amp;rsquo;s been a full year since I started on Posterous. The idea behind it was simple - I was scatter-gunning techie posts across several blogs and they just didn&amp;rsquo;t belong there mixed in with foodie stuff and business. I wanted somewhere I could completely geek-out but with zero effort. Over the year I think most posts have taken 5 minutes to write and the bulk of them were sent by email when I was killing some time or on a lazy Saturday.</description>

My mum bought some very funny flamenco dresses for my two girls recently in Spain. Total spotty horrors but the girls loved them. She just topped that by getting them spotty flamenco shoes with big stomping wedge heels on them.

As they were bought in a local mini-mart in Torremolinos, the quality ain&amp;rsquo;t great, to put it mildly. S&amp;iacute;ofra popped the clasp rivet on hers within a couple of hours and left too big a hole to just pop it back in.</description>

Over the past few months, I&amp;#39;ve watched Facebook Places functionality get closer and closer to properly live for those of us in Ireland.We geeks initially used VPNs on our phones to spoof that we were in the US so we could check-in in Ireland. Then I spotted the FB Ireland people checking in here. More recently the Android App stopped giving an error and showed check-ins here.</description>

Sometimes you have to stop blogging and you have to start coding to scratch a persistent intellectual itch. Last week I said&amp;nbsp;I needed self-curated news for the Irish General Election. This week I have it.
Curation by Me is an incredibly simple tool I lashed together (using the Programming by Google Search method) over the past two nights. It takes the URL of a Twitter list and a hashtag/keyword to provide you with a filtered list of tweets.</description>

One of the pressies that Santy gave to our 11 y/o son was a Hexapod Monster robot. It&amp;rsquo;s a self-assembly kit that should result in a robot that can walk around and avoid obstacles. The youngfella has had plenty of experience building ever more complex Lego so this looked like a good next step before perhaps considering Lego Mindstorms.

Once we looked at the kit, we realised he couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it on his own and I&amp;rsquo;d have to help.</description>

via androidguys.com As opposed to Decency Filters :-) I&#39;ve only just started playing with the feature and amazingly, it isn&#39;t just the best implementation on a mobile, it&#39;s the best implementation anywhere. Your can mute people, hashtags or keywords. Tweetdeck, Seesmic et al should be ashamed of themselves for the lack of progress in this area on the desktop. Speaking of which there is a Chrome plugin for Twitter which does filtering called Slipstream.</description>

There is one area where the internet has gone backwards in the past 10 years and that&amp;rsquo;s discussion sites. From 1992 to probably 2003, I got a huge amount of information using Usenet, more than I got on the web. Unfortunately, despite still existing in 2011, Usenet has become a spam hellhole and most discussions have moved to the web. If you go onto most of these sites, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably see vBulletin, phpBB, BBPress or some other crime against humanity powering it.</description>

Twitter Emergency Rapid Response On-Site Reporting = TERROR No, acronyms have never been my strength.My CorkProbs idea on Twitter back in 2007 never got any traction. Mainly because there were possibly 10 people in Cork on Twitter at the time. The idea was simply that locals would tweet @CorkProbs about problems related to roads, electricity, gas, water etc and the account would re-tweet them. It was prompted by a water outage in Bandon where no-one in the Council could tell us what theproblemwas or take responsibility for finding out.</description>

I got very excited earlier in the year when Twitter announced the Annotations feature. It&amp;#39;s a way of adding metadata to a tweet such that it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be user-visible. Of course the one use case that many of us thought of was reviews. You could add the rating, url etc as metadata and use the tweet for the summary. Then twitter clients could potentially interpret that and show reviews in Twitter with stars etc.</description>

 Thanks to the brilliant Richard Trip, whose DeFroST ROM I use every day on my phone, we now also have the a rough cut of Gingerbread on the Desire. Initial impressions are that not much has changed except for some bling. I know most of the changes are under the hood. Seems to be rock solid. Haven&amp;#39;t found any problems yet.</description>

Until my recent falling out with DealExtreme over their refusal to refund me for a returned item, I spent a lot of money on their site buying various gadgets and gizmos. The trick is to buy really cheap things so that if they break or aren&amp;rsquo;t quite what you wanted, you can bin them or try and use them for something else.</description>

This is as close as I can get:
 &amp;nbsp;
But Mapquest Open&amp;nbsp;is using OpenStreetMap data. And OSM can zoom in wayyyy beyond that.&amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;
What&amp;rsquo;s the problem I wonder?

Totally brilliant. Effectively a Facebook Like button for a product that will give me 30% off when I show it on my phone in-store. This is where 4SQ can nail it.</description>

I&amp;#39;ve spent the past week with a column in Tweetdeck tracking #bailout and it makes for rivetting reading. On the one hand you have the official blather about &amp;quot;steady as she goes&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;everything is stabilised now&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Spain won&amp;#39;t need a bailout&amp;quot;. And on the other hand you have the aggregate of thousands of average people all saying the opposite. The trick is figuring out whether that aggregate is the wisdom of crowds or the same type of mass hysteria that created the bubble in the first place.</description>

Big hat-tip to&amp;nbsp;@micflan&amp;nbsp;for pointing me in the right direction on this recently. I had tried and failed several times previously.
I did a post a few months back about getting streaming media working on both old Nokia N770s and iPhone from an Easy Peasy based EeePC netbook running MediaTomb. The idea was that it could be the ultimate in-car media center. The one massive annoyance was that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it working on Android due to it having only one crappy non-functional UPnP client.</description>

The app gets better and better and I&amp;#39;m thrilled they have launched a standalone box. Quick aside: Any chance they&amp;#39;d sell the Boxee remote for us PC owners? I bloody hate the generic MCE one we have. Living 2km from an Irish town centre as we do, video streaming is not an option after 7pm.</description>

The problem was exacerbated by Google allowing people to create half-assed Google Accounts with the same email address as their Google Apps account but which were in fact completely different. Google is rightly now trying to clean this mess up and I don&amp;#39;t envy them but gawd it&amp;#39;s a complete pain in the arse.</description>

I couldn&amp;#39;t resist when I was in London recently and grabbed one in Bayswater. Even the young lad in the shop thought Orange was crazy with the low pricing.

A hook for my Skype phone. Reinforced with a paper clip. Rather proud of it I must say. I&amp;rsquo;ll&amp;nbsp;upload&amp;nbsp;the horror that is the back of our Sky+ controls later (3 colours!)

via forum.swype.com After being a complete Swype fanatic since I first got my hands on it, I actually had to uninstall it recently. It was getting more words wrong than right. It looks like they have fixed that problem so off I go to re-install now.

I know I know, I do the early adopter crap all the time. &amp;quot;Broadcast TV is dead&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Shows will all be single-purchase via IPTV in 2 years&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t even know who presents the News on RTE now&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Late Late What?&amp;quot;.But the average punter is still tuning in and watching the same old stuff, maybe a bit time-delayed by Sky+, but that&amp;#39;s it.So, as always, we have to look at what the kids are doing to see what&amp;#39;s really coming next.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Sharing Family Videos using Amazon Cloudfront, CloudBerry, JWPlayer and Wordpress&amp;rdquo;
We have tons of old video going back to 1997 that I have been capturing as MPG files over the past few years with WinTV boxes. They then sat unloved on a harddrive until now. We have recently got family requests for copies of some of the videos and it prompted me to finally do something. I had considered burning DVDs but they are just going to get lost/scratched and I&amp;#39;ve always found generating them to be a complete pain.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;The Importance of Interfaces&amp;rdquo;
I&amp;#39;ve recently been thinking about how interfaces and standards are so important.
One challenge we have as a family with a huge number of kids is playing media when we visit various grandparents or in-laws. During the winter this is even more important. There are only so many DS games, episodes of iCarly or y8.com games they will play. The same is true when I&amp;#39;m travelling and I want to chill out with a movie in a hotel and not be gouged.</description>

  I got an iGo Stowaway Keyboard nearly three years ago for my Nokia N95-8GB and N770 at a knock-down price. I still think it is one of the greatest pieces of industrial design out there. It never got huge use but was invaluable when I really needed it. For the past few months I&amp;#39;ve used it as the keyboard for our Boxee PC.</description>

After all, if you&amp;rsquo;re a consumer, another great deal is always around the corner, so why ever pay full price? Other local businesses offering the same products or services will always have deals of their own. Just wait a few days. Further, as more and more businesses discount for the likes of Groupon, they erode their own perceived value, and destroy their own pricing power.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Interesting way to order \&amp;ldquo;impossible\&amp;rdquo; things from abroad&amp;rdquo;
I spotted this on one of the Android forums earlier. It&amp;rsquo;s a way of ordering things from abroad from vendors who won&amp;rsquo;t ship outside of their own country. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of similar in the US for years but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it was here in Europe too.
The service is called Borderlinx and appears to be facilitated by DHL. So you order something from the UK and give the Borderlinx UK address for delivery.</description>

My feelings about the iPad remain little-changed since launch despite having played with one several times. Having said that, if I had lots of disposable income and bought XBox360s, PS3s or the latest laptop on a whim, I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;d have dipped my toe in. But as a must-have device, it ticks no boxes for me.
The one area where tablets make complete sense for me is with kids.</description>

Here we are 10 years later and the type of people who apply to be on The Apprentice in the UK and Ireland still think words like &amp;quot;Fusion&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Synergy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Apollo&amp;quot; are something other than laughable.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Accessing Amazon RDS Instances from your Desktop&amp;rdquo;
Whilst we are huge fans of the Amazon RDS database service (particularly the Multi-AZ setup), one thing that can be a problem is accessing your databases from the desktop. The standard trick of running an SSH tunnel to your EC2 instance doesn&amp;rsquo;t work here.&amp;nbsp;

After much searching I found the following on an AWS discussion forum and it works perfectly: ssh-add YourKey.pem  ssh -l &amp;lt;username&amp;gt; -L 33060:&amp;lt;ec2_rfc_ip&amp;gt;:3306 -N &amp;lt;ext_hostname&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;Then connect your local MySQL client to localhost, port 33060&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;username&amp;gt; is the login user on the EC2 instance from where you normally access the RDS MySQL DB.</description>

Recently we were suddenly unable to access the shares from Ubuntu or XBMC but all was still fine from the Windows PCs. And those PCs had no problem sharing to Ubuntu/XMBC.</description>

UberCab contracts with black car services mostly Towncars and Escalades. Theres a lot of unused inventory in those businesses and they are happy to work with someone who eats up that inventory.

The built-in PPTN VPN is utterly broken and does not work over 3G at all or for more than a few minutes on Wifi. The steps to get an alternative working on a HTC Desire are as follows:</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Android not suitable for the Enterprise?&amp;rdquo;
I&amp;#39;m been trying and failing to get two features working on Android over the weekend: VPN and Proxy. A ton of googling revealed that both are utterly broken and have been since V1.0 of Android. Whilst my use-case is trivial (getting Facebook Places working outside of the US), the much bigger use case is a much bigger deal: the Enterprise. I have read tons of posts with people pulling their hair out as they either cannot get these features working or can&amp;#39;t get them working reliably.</description>

  I&amp;#39;ve been saying it for months, but Social Check-in will be owned by Facebook and Google. Startups that didn&amp;#39;t take M&amp;amp;A offers from them are completely deluded. This is not a &amp;quot;we could be the next Twitter&amp;quot; scenario. Now that I&amp;#39;ve seen Facebook Places in action, I believe that even more
I finally managed to get Places working by saying I was in Palo Alto and connecting to http://touch.</description>

U.S. Only to start with. GrrrrrrrrrrMobile-Web-based for most which is fineiPhone before Android. Grrrrrr.Facebook Pages are not the sames as Places Pages. That&amp;#39;s a bit odd. Surely the intersection of a Page&amp;#39;s Fans (or Likers or whatever they are called now) and people who check-in is really powerful? Or is it that you have one Starbucks Page but you need 400,000 Starbucks Places Pages? Which makes sense I guess.</description>

Facebook&amp;#39;s upgrade of the Notes feature this week set me thinking. I asked the simple question if this is another step towards Facebook being &amp;quot;your web-page&amp;quot;. First they had to open everything up, now you have permanent pages with your thoughts and simple formatting is allowed. What if they were indexable? What if you had a custom domain for your entire Profile?</description>

When I upgraded to the HTC Desire, I gave my old G1 to my eldest son. We try to keep it up-to-date and it is currently running the Cyanogen version of Android 2.2 Froyo. One problem he ran into is that he is on a PAYG O2 SIM and relies on the indulgence of his Grandparents and Aunties/Uncles for call credit.</description>

App is giving plenty of &#34;bad connection&#34; errors but always works on the second attempt. Looks lovely and can be region set to Ireland.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ve had a big-assed 50L Brabantia bin for the past 6 years or so. In their wisdom, Brabantia realise that the crappy catches they put on their bins break regularly and not only provide a spare but make it very easy to order another:
  Unfortunately, what they didn&amp;rsquo;t suss was basic mechanical engineering and the fracture mechanics of 5 children whacking the bin-lidhard every time they opened and closed it.</description>

After much feedback from people and some cunningly slipped-through tweets, this filter seems to be 100% solid for removing every Tweet, Facebook update, Buzz buzzinga, Foursquare update and LinkedIn update on TweetDeck. It&amp;#39;ll also remove a certain percentage of totally unrelated tweets but that&amp;#39;s the price of mental peace. How many weeks is this kick-about due to last anyway?</description>

I just got my new ATM card in the post from Ulster Bank and it&amp;#39;s no longer a Laser Card, it&amp;#39;s Visa Debit. They claim it is accepted in more places globally. This seems reasonable since I have never seen Laser as an online payment method outside of Ireland. One trick a lot of people have been using (the guys in Curious Wines told me about it) when buying Ryanair tickets is to use an Entropay Virtual Debit Card.</description>

Quick one on VP8. i&amp;#39;m thrilled Google have done this since the whole MPEG LA thing hanging over h.264 was worryin a lot of people. But.A lot of PC video cards and more importantly, smartphones, now have h.264 hardware decoders so they can play the video without melting the main CPU. Are those decoders hardwired to the h.264 algorithms or will they also be able to handle VP8?</description>

After some more reading on the lack of Paid Apps in Ireland, it appears that all the blame may not be on Google after all. From what I can see, Mobile Operators in each country have to sign up to the Open Handset Alliance (OHA) to get &amp;ldquo;access&amp;rdquo; to the Android Market.
How much do you bet that none of the Irish operators have done so?</description>

THE BEHAVIOUR OF the institutional Catholic church in Ireland and around the world is certainly a stark example of both of these truths. But it is not the only example, even in contemporary Ireland. The Irish Amateur Swimming Association, for example, gave coaches the power to do what they liked to children and then engaged in a process of denial that was, albeit on a much smaller scale, essentially the same as that of the bishops.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Twitter tackling potential spam/abuse hard&amp;rdquo;
I got a shock last night to receive an email from Twitter support to say that an OAuth Token we had configured had been suspended due to potential abuse.A quick explanation of what that means: When clients add LouderVoice customer reviews to their site, we provide the ability for their users to Login with Facebook and Twitter credentials and also to send a copy of their review to their Facebook or Twitter Account.</description>

Was it PCW&amp;rsquo;s Elan Enterprise I swiped (finally, I admit it), or was it What Micro&amp;rsquo;s? Whatever, publisher VNU finally woke up to the insanity of competing with itself and pink-slipped PCN. Other titles faded as the 80s home computing boom faded, but PCW and Guy sailed on, with Guy as the IT guru normal people had quite possibly heard of - and the one the vendors needed to talk to.</description>

 Today, Nokia has responded making Ovi Maps 3 available for the E71 and E66 too.

People will be able to use Ovi Suite to side load the latest country maps onto their devices so they can enjoy offline map browsing alongside free navigation. The process of making the latest version of Ovi Maps available for existing devices is quite involved, but the team managed to include complete navigation functionality.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Android need some hardware standards&amp;rdquo;
Anyone who knows me is sick of my bitching and moaning about the closed nature of the iPhone. But that closed nature has one huge advantage; a global ecosystem of accessories has built up around it. From cases to speaker docks to headphones, suppliers work with fixed form factors and interfaces.
That ecosystem must now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year. It strikes me that Android could achieve the same thing but in an open way and with a focus on interfaces rather than form factors.</description>

I was contacted a while back by the guys in Innovator.ie about an Innovation Workshop but I mis-read the intent and thought it was just for those in the Civil Security Sector.</description>

I&amp;#39;ve had O2 mobile broadband for something like 2 years. I haven&amp;#39;t used it much at all in the past few months and cancelled it a few weeks back. It was costing 30 p.m. for 10GB. However the ongoing problems with Eircom DSL every single night from 7pm to midnight has been driving me insane. Throughput drops to almost 0bps. The feedback I see on Twitter is that I&amp;#39;m not the only one and Cork seems to be particularly bad.</description>

For nowhere in the eight page letter is there an unambiguous acceptance of responsibility for the global systemic cover up of child sexual abuse by priests. Nor is there any acknowledgement of the years of aggressive refusal on the part of the Vatican to accept the simple fact of clerical crimes and institutional church cover up.&amp;nbsp;

I dunno if these stats are good, bad or indifferent for a new blog that is 99% promoted via Twitter and Facebook links. The one that jumps out at me is that whilst Twitter generates 18% of the visits, Facebook only generates 4%.</description>

All previous versions of Ubuntu had a colour scheme even more offensive than black: pooh brown. It&amp;rsquo;s the first thing I change whenever I install it.&amp;nbsp;I was really happy to see the purple boot screen on this new version of Ubuntu but that turned to horror when it finally loaded and everything else was black.</description>

In May of that year, Ratzinger issued a confidential letter to every bishop. In it, he reminded them of the extreme gravity of a certain crime. But that crime was the reporting of the rape and torture. The accusations, intoned Ratzinger, were only treatable within the church&amp;rsquo;s own exclusive jurisdiction. Any sharing of the evidence with legal authorities or the press was utterly forbidden.</description>

If someone knows how to lock the N770 screen without causing the video to pause and creating a catch-22, let me know.</description>

(thanks to those lovely people who gave me those tips) If this is the subtle non-intrusive advertising that Ev Williams and Biz Stone are going to roll out to all their users, gawd help us all.</description>

West Cork Tourism began its campaign at the beginning of 2009 to raise funds to get a service back on the Cork Swansea route and a co-op was formed with some 300 members who each contributed 10,000 towards the cost of purchasing a boat.

&amp;nbsp;
Our house is surrounded by small hills so, despite being only 2km from the cop station base-station, even voice calls are a constant pain. SMS arrival time can be measured in hours depending on where we are in the house. There is a one-bar GPRS data signal sometimes using an E270 broadband dongle.
After the floods took out Eircom but not Vodafone and O2, I realised that I could get HSDPA on O2 by sticking the dongle on a bamboo cane and sticking the bamboo cane in a tree fern.</description>

This was a challenging inquiry which provoked strong reactions. We were seeking to determine whether the Governments policies on homeopathy are evidence based on current evidence. They are not.
It sets an unfortunate precedent for the Department of Health to consider that the existence of a community which believes that homeopathy works is evidence enough to continue spending public money on it.</description>

My Da&amp;rsquo;s 12 year old BMW will fail its NCT unless he has 5 grand of work done on it so he has finally decided to get a new one. The new 520d and 525d are catching his eye. The advantage of the 525d is that it is available in March. The big disadvantage is a massive price uplift over the 520d. But he can&amp;rsquo;t really wait until July for the 520d to be released.</description>

Recently I cancelled my contract for O2 mobile broadband. I was dishing out 30 per month for a service I maybe using a few days a month. I found that the N95-8GB or HTC G1 as a tethered modem with a 1GB data add-on for my Vodafone phone SIM was more than sufficient for my current needs. However, it seemed an awful shame to leave the Huawei E270 modem unused since it is bloody good and does 7.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Deeply satisfying to overclock my phone&amp;rdquo;
SetCPU changes the CPU clock (overclock, underclock, or tweak speeds) on your rooted G1, ADP1, Magic, Nexus, or Droid to increase performance or save battery.
via androlib.com In the old days I did it on PC CPUs but that doesn&#39;t compare to overclocking my G1 phone from 384MHz to 528MHz. Supposedly some people have it stable at 700MHz. A hackers delight.

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;My Profile on Google Buzz is&amp;hellip;., but I ain&amp;rsquo;t happy&amp;rdquo;
Right, I&amp;#39;m in playing with Google Buzz on the Desktop and I don&amp;#39;t like it but I&amp;#39;ll keep at it for a while. It&amp;#39;s Friendfeed 2.0, and we all know what a roaring success that was.A bigger problem is the lack of GoogApps account support. I have driven all my mail through that account for the past three years. Now I have to revert to an old semi-dead GMail account to use Buzz.</description>

It looks like Google Buzz accounts inside your GMail are like hen&amp;rsquo;s teeth at the minute but if you are desperate to try it out and you have a smartphone you should be in luck.
Just use your phone to go to http://google.com/buzz and it&amp;rsquo;ll probably let you set up an account there and give you access to the mobile web version of Buzz If you have an Android, Nokia N-series/E-series or WiMo phone you&amp;rsquo;ll also be able to install a Google Maps upgrade that has Buzz features built-in.</description>

Yes just 4 of Google&amp;rsquo;s attempts to do &amp;ldquo;Social&amp;rdquo; online. All complete flops. Or growing until Google bought them and killed them.
It&amp;rsquo;s pretty hard for an organisation that&amp;rsquo;s built on secrecy to build something social.
When has a representative of Google Ireland ever attended any local event here in an official capacity? Or sponsored one? Figure the basics out before you start trying to apply technology to a human activity.</description>

But not one mention of N95, N96 and a bazillion other N-series handsets which are owned by people who actually use Social Networks on their phones. But my mother-in-law who can just about handle email on a PC and uses her candybar S40 phone for calls and SMS only is now supported?</description>

We signed up for Eircom 7 Mbs broadband last year having moved from dial-up -&amp;gt; ISDN -&amp;gt; 2 Mbs -&amp;gt; 3 Mbs since arriving in Bandon in 2003. However, the lines out to Old Chapel are allegedly &amp;quot;rubbish&amp;quot;, whatever that means. So despite being less than 2km from the exchange, we were mainly connecting at 4Mbs on the 7Mbs line. Or worse, connecting at 5.5 and falling back to 4 or worse.</description>

The kids use one of my old PCs to access all their favourite sites and print stuff off on a 10 year old Epson Inkjet. It&amp;rsquo;s a solid setup and they are happy with it. However, as it was a self-build, it never had a Windows licence and actually runs Ubuntu Linux.I&amp;rsquo;ve always found it interesting that the kids could switch from XP to Windows 7 to Ubuntu on different PCs and laptops without comment.</description>

I know we are early adopters/geeks but I think what we are doing with media consumption is a reflection of what will happen in the mainstream in the next two years. Like many people we have been long signed-up to some stupid rip-off Sky package involving movies, multi-room and Sky+. it was costing north of 75 a month.

One thing that has me incensed about Google is how the country that enables them to avoid tax on billions of dollars in revenue is generally paddy-last (pun intended) when it comes to app support.It was only in late 2008 that Google Maps finally showed more than one road in West Cork. Their most recent manifestation of this attitude is the lack of paid apps for Irish users of Android phones.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Xperia X10 lands on Vodafone UK in April &amp;ndash; Engadget&amp;rdquo;
 
via engadget.com The ultimate Android phone. Massive screen, 8MP camera, kick-ass CPU. Surely tho they&#39;ll have it on Android 2.1 before release? 1.6 would be a huge mistake. Fingers crossed Vodafone Ireland stocks it so I can get cheap on my upgrade. Would still prefer to keyboard tho. It&#39;s the one killer feature of the G1. So Nokia, you have 2-3 months to blow my mind with a new product (think N900 with capacative screen and 8MP camera) before you lose me forever to Android and I retire my N95-8GB.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Symbian Open-Sourcing Gut Reaction&amp;rdquo;
So Symbian is now fully Open-Sourced.I bang the &amp;quot;Symbian is dead&amp;quot; drum quite a bit but it&amp;#39;s more coming from a punter perspective than any industry insight. I have an N95-8GB and a HTC G1. The hardware on the N95 is fabulous, the apps are solid, the OS gets in my way all the time. The hardware on the G1 is rubbish, the apps are fabulous and the OS stays out of my way.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Machform nicely formed&amp;rdquo;
When the new biz site launched we used the Contact Form 7 plugin for Wordpress. Whilst it does a good job for basic forms, we soon ran into its limitations. I had seen good success in the past with Machform on the BarCamp Cork site so gave that a trial instead.It&amp;rsquo;s working really well for us. Install is trivial and creating forms is all drag n drop. It&amp;rsquo;s very inexpensive at &amp;euro;29 and the forms can be pasted into most sites with almost no effort.</description>

Catherine found a charge on our Mastercard recently that we could not get to the bottom of. We then discovered it recurred all the way back to September. It was from &amp;quot;Click and Buy&amp;quot;. We contacted Mastercard but all they could say was &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s for professional services&amp;quot;. I went on to Click and Buy to discover a lot of online gambling logos. So of course we suspected the card had been hijacked.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Android soon for \u008030?&amp;rdquo;
Finally got my two-year upgrade on Vodafone Ireland. Had a look at what&amp;#39;s on offer. N97-mini for 120 is good value but I hate resistive screens and the lack of memory.Oh, what&amp;#39;s this? The Vodafone H1 360 for 30? A linux-based phone, social media enabled, 5 MP camera, wifi, 3G, bluetooth, Cortex A8 kick-ass CPU, lots of memory. Is that a typo? No, it is 30.Read some reviews (particularly Ewan on Mobile Industry Review).</description>

 I signed up on the Sony Ericsson site to be notified when the Xperia X10 Android phone was launched. But they also decided to add me to their newsletter mailing list. Grrrrrrreat.Today they think I&amp;#39;d like to buy this wonderful Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana JalouNo.</description>

So after checking out CloudOS, I loaded up JoliCloud onto a thumbdrive. Tariq Krim&amp;rsquo;s quick presentation at Le Web had caught my interest.I was a bit stunned to find myself booting into Ubuntu NBR Linux. And not quickly. Hardly a new paradigm.I create a Jolicloud account and&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.&amp;ldquo;Here are some apps you can install in your linux box. Here are some other webapps, not specific to Jolicloud&amp;rdquo;I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t get it.</description>

      <description>#&amp;ldquo;Instant Google CloudOS Reaction&amp;rdquo;
On Monday night I grabbed an image of Google&amp;rsquo;s not-yet-released CloudOS operating system, stuck it on a USB stick and booted my Acer Aspire One netbook with it. In under10 seconds I had a login prompt. 5 seconds after that I was in and using it. Pretty shockingly impressive.It currently a very basic desktop with mainly links to web apps. Browser is obviously Chrome.Very slow (since it is totally non-optimised for any hardware) but amazingly, video works, network works, decent resolution works.</description>

Like many people, my blogging activities have collapsed. A lot of that is due to work commitment but another large part of it is that I post most quick thoughts and ideas to Twitter or Facebbok.
The problem there is discoverability and conversation threads. Sure someone can find a tweet weeks later but they&amp;rsquo;ll never be able to reply to it in an intelligible way.
But I still don&amp;rsquo;t have time to do full blog posts.</description>

The horror, the horror. 1989-1989, Philips Eindhoven: Computervision Workstation. Cool. 1989-1990, UCD Eng: PC, DOS. Final year project. Happy days. C 1990-1992, UCD Eng Masters: PC Windows 3.0 and HP Apollo HPUX. Both fab. C, C++.</description>
