        <p>Intro After the silly complexity and Hackaday article! of last year, I decided to keep it simple for Halloween this year. Of course that worked out :-)
The kids' favourite thing from all our Halloweens was the doorbell that made scary sounds. So that became the focus. As I hadn&rsquo;t really done anything with my two C.H.I.P.s, I picked one to handle the bulk of the activity. I immediately became a big fan of its small size, built-in Wifi and simple Linux UI. <a class="read-more" href="/2016/11/29/all-the-grisly-details-of-skeletony-and-the-halloween-doorbell-of-doom-v20/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A couple of weeks ago, I took my Galaxy S6 out for a run in the rain and it died. Based on previous experience with the horror known as Vodafone Ireland Insurance, I figured I&rsquo;d be looking at 10 days minimum to get a replacement. This proved 100% accurate as the usual completely inept software that connects Vodafone&rsquo;s PDP-11 to Stay Mobile&rsquo;s Commodore 64 had cancelled my insurance without notification several months previously. <a class="read-more" href="/2016/10/02/quick-review-of-the-blu-life-mark-android-phone/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Like my kids, I love regular YouTubers. My particular favourites are the tech, craft, metal and woodworking people who make amazing things every week. Those gals and guys have to be watched to really get the value from them and here&rsquo;s a few more worth looking at too, of course not forgetting these other gems.
But there are others I love equally where it&rsquo;s mostly about what they are saying. For example, Ethan Newberry (aka The Ginger Runner) does a fantastic weekly live session where he mostly interviews Ultra runners. <a class="read-more" href="/2016/05/02/introducing-ytpodders-get-your-fave-youtubers-as-audio-podcasts-on-your-phone/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I previously wrote about using gccgo to build Go binaries for the Onion Omega due to Go&rsquo;s lack of support for MIPS CPUs. But TBH it&rsquo;s a pain in the butt. Things were looking up when it was revealed that Go 1.6 would have MIPS support but sadly it&rsquo;s for MIPS64 only, for datacenter applications I guess.
However Cathal Garvey discovered a GitHub repo where some lovely person has ported v1. <a class="read-more" href="/2016/02/08/three-ways-to-build-go-1.4-binaries-for-mips32-onion-omega/">&raquo;</a></p>

Or would have told Linus in no uncertain terms that he was misguided and that microkernels were the future.

ESP8266 $1 Wifi modules I&rsquo;ve talked about the ESP8266 constantly all year. A price-point of ~$1 in volume means that you can wifi-enable anything. Where previously you might have used one of the many low bandwidth &ldquo;IoT&rdquo; protocols internally and connected them to hub-device, now you can do Wifi and IP end-to-end. The only downside is high power consumption. <a class="read-more" href="/2015/12/31/what-excited-conor-in-tech-in-2015/">&raquo;</a></p>
