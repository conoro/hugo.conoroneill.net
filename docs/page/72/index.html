I've been making my own little client sign-up workflow inside Wordpress but there is a definite opportunity for someone to build a mini-workflow-engine for WP.Just pages/forms with strong conditional logic and branching and go-back. My kludge with a long page hierarchy, smart url naming and Gravity Forms will do in the short term but I could really do with the branching to separate pages based on input to forms (e. <a class="read-more" href="/2010/02/14/anyone-got-a-workflow-engine-for-wordpress/">&raquo;</a></p>

I speak from a tiny bit of knowledge of Haiti, having spoken this weekend with a number of people who were out there on Havens last trip and having had a call with someone out there yesterday, they were roaming on the Haitian mobile network Digicel which appears to be almost fully operational. via patphelan.net I'm sure Evert means well but unless he is invited by one of the major charities on the ground, publicly, to come to Haiti and help, he should stop now. <a class="read-more" href="/2010/02/14/pat-is-right-about-haiti-connect/">&raquo;</a></p>

Firefox 3.6 final is released and&nbsp;yet again,&nbsp;most Ubuntu users are not able to upgrade their resident Firefox 3.5 to this latest release. Let's cut the chase. All you need to do is to get the latest version of Ubuntuzilla, a python script which pretty much gets the job done, and you will have you Firefox 3.6 installed and ready to rock. <a class="read-more" href="/2010/02/13/install-firefox-3-6-in-ubuntu-the-super-easy-way-using-ubuntuzilla-tech-drive/">&raquo;</a></p>

  via readwriteweb.com Interesting timing. My kids just went through a site like this with a critical eye and the opinions varied wildly between the 8 y/o and the 10 y/i. If you have kids under 12, they'd appreciate it if you could fill out a survey with the kids beside you.

 via businessinsider.com I am now convinced no-one outside of Google ever tested this product before they went for global launch. I am also convinced that no-one inside Google had the balls to tell the people who built it that it was riddled with problems and was about as ready for release as Duke Nukem Forever. I don't think I've ever seen a webapp released with so many fundamental glaring flaws in all my life by a global company. <a class="read-more" href="/2010/02/12/outraged-blogger-is-automatically-being-followed-by-her-abusive-ex-husband-on-google-buzz/">&raquo;</a></p>

"What's wrong with rolling out an Irish-wide blogging system? The model has been tested since 1999 by several Irish bloggers. The back-ends are simple modifications of Perl, PHP, and scripted environments.

    via techcrunch.com I pointed out yesterday that if you @ someone in Buzz, it posts their email address in the buzzinga, which is mind-boggingly stupid. Techcrunch has now run with a similar story.
But the important bit is the Google response. Read it and weep.
They actually think that people only have one email address! Hell even my technophobic Dad and Mother-in-law each have two, one from ISP and one from GMail. <a class="read-more" href="/2010/02/12/quite-clear-that-google-doesnt-understand-its-own-product-buzz/">&raquo;</a></p>

  via gravityforms.com I really like Machform but the lack of conditional fields was killing me along with the necessity to edit CSS to make the forms match the site theme.  What I really need is a full workflow system but this should do the trick for the time being. And I got 20% off using WOOFORM20 so that's nice :-)
