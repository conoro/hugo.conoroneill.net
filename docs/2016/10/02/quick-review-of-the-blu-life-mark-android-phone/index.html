      <p>A couple of weeks ago, I took my Galaxy S6 out for a run in the rain and it died. Based on previous experience with the horror known as Vodafone Ireland Insurance, I figured I&rsquo;d be looking at 10 days minimum to get a replacement. This proved 100% accurate as the usual completely inept software that connects Vodafone&rsquo;s PDP-11 to Stay Mobile&rsquo;s Commodore 64 had cancelled my insurance without notification several months previously. It took them a week to sort this out before they could even look at replacing the phone.</p>
<p>So the same day it died, I ordered a cheap replacement backup phone which arrived within 2 days from <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/BLU-Life-Mark-SIM-Free-Smartphone/dp/B01CG0U6U0/">Amazon UK</a>. Yep, you can order and receive a new phone from the UK faster than two groups of circus clowns in Dublin can fix a mistake they made.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://bluproducts.com/life-mark">BLU Life Mark</a> is an utterly generic low-mid range Android phone from a US-based company. It&rsquo;s very similar to the Wileyfox Swift I got my mother-in-law a few months back, which she loves.</p>

<p>This won&rsquo;t be a long review as there really isn&rsquo;t anything new to say about modern smartphones. Slabs of glass that still can&rsquo;t tell the difference between accidental and intended touch or learn anything about your usage and optimise accordingly.</p>
<p>It has a 720p screen of decent brightness and perfectly acceptable touch responsiveness. It uses a Mediatek chipset which, whilst it isn&rsquo;t particularly fast, is fine for 90% of the population. It lags when opening the camera or launching Facebook but otherwise it&rsquo;s grand.</p>
<p>It can take 2 SIM cards or a SIM plus an SD Card. Which is more than can be said for Samsung or HTC.</p>
<p>Battery life seemed a bit weak compared to an S6.</p>
<p>The fingerprint scanner is superb. It&rsquo;s not only in the correct place, the back, it is also extremely fast. I can&rsquo;t abide the one on the S6 and have it disabled.</p>
<p>The camera isn&rsquo;t brilliant. 13MP in theory but nowhere close to the S6. But for day to day, it does the job.</p>
<p>The GPS/Compass is a bit crap. Google Maps spun around like a tasmanian devil whilst trying to navigate on foot around Berlin. Positional accuracy seemed ok tho. Both Google Maps and Scout worked fine otherwise in Berlin.</p>
<p>The only seriously bad part of using it for a week was the Bluetooth. I paired it to Sync 2 on my Mondeo and initially it streamed my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/adam-buxton">Adam Buxton podcast</a> perfectly. But after a few miles driving, it started cutting in and out &ldquo;randomly&rdquo;. It was driving me nuts. Then I sussed that the cut-outs happened when I was passing other cars. So I&rsquo;m now pretty sure the bloody thing was trying to have a Bluetooth chat with every phone and car it could see. Unfortunately this high-speed connect/disconnect sent the car&rsquo;s Bluetooth stack nuts. I then couldn&rsquo;t connect properly from any phone. Factory defaults and Master Reset failed to fix it. Eventually I had to disconnect the car battery to reboot the car! That worked. Now I know this might have been the car&rsquo;s fault but it has worked seamlessly with the S6 and an iPhone for months so I&rsquo;m blaming the BLU.</p>
<p>Overall, unless you are a Bluetooth streaming fiend like me, you&rsquo;ll find little to complain about in this phone. It&rsquo;s really quite wonderful that you can have a supercomputer in your hand with access to all the world&rsquo;s information for £80 without any contract. It&rsquo;s a great time to be alive.</p>
<p>Oh and the S6 somehow fully recovered after I kept it in a very warm place for a few days. So that&rsquo;s €60 I won&rsquo;t be giving to the Stay Mobile Clown Retirement Fund.</p>
