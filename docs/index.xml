      <description>My RasPad
arrived this morning and I&amp;rsquo;m very impressed after just a few minutes of checking it out.
I grabbed a Pi3 that has RetroPie installed on it and inserted it into the bay.
Loved playing SNES Galaxians at lunchtime!</description>

      <description>I have almost completed a simple new tool which enables you to send blog
content via email. The emails are converted to Markdown files and then
uploaded to my Hugo source repo, along with any inline images.
CircleCI then automatically rebuilds and redeploys my blog to S3.
I&amp;rsquo;ll post full details and source code over the next few days.</description>

      <title>Fund this project to add Allwinner VPU support to the official Linux kernel</title>

      <description>Anyone who has any interaction with technology benefits from all of the work done by Open Source developers around the world from the past few decades. Unfortunately there are far more takers than givers. I think there is a strong chance that many OSS developers will become burnt out and disenchanted with building things for free when others reap the commercial rewards.
Many of the Chinese silicon and box companies are particularly bad at providing proper maintanined OS support for their devices.</description>

      <description>The 1980s home computer retro scene remains very vibrant. I dip a toe in every so often and recently have been enjoying the new Speccy games that I&amp;rsquo;ve found on Indie Retro News.
One thing that caught my eye with these releases was the mentions of &amp;ldquo;engines&amp;rdquo;. It turns out that people have been building games engines for the ZX Spectrum for years. Mostly in C it seems and mostly using the z88dk toolchain.</description>

      <title>What do you think of when you read that Open Source is 20 years old?</title>

      <description>Yesterday I read that Open Source is offically 20 years old. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean free software or GNU or anything like that, just the definition and initiative itself. It made me think about all of open source (lower case) and free software that&amp;rsquo;s had an impact on me since I was a teenager. Here&amp;rsquo;s that as a quick brain-dump. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ve missed tons and will update as they pop into my head.</description>

      <description>One of the all-time great tools of the internet era is youtube-dl. It enables you to download any YouTube video for watching offline/later. It has been a fantastic boon over the years for watching all my hundreds of subscribed channels when in planes, trains, automobiles and treadmills. It&amp;rsquo;s also the basis for my own YTPodders tool for generating podcasts from videos.
Normally I run it on the PC and copy the files to the mobile devices, tablets or media players.</description>

      <description>If you attended NodeConf EU 2017 in Kilkenny, Ireland, you&amp;rsquo;ll know all about the digital badge powered by Espruino that we created with Gordon Williams. You can read more about it on the nearForm blog and check out the docs site.
I hope you&amp;rsquo;ve continued to learn about Espruino and the power of JavaScript on tiny microcontrollers. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget it&amp;rsquo;s entirely Open Source Software and Hardware. Our Github repo is here.</description>

      <title>My Media Players in 2017</title>

      <description>Our journey with media players started a long time ago by adding a hardware hack to an original pre-360 XBOX so it could run XBMC. We&amp;rsquo;ve gone through a bunch of devices since, with the Raspberry Pi being the mainstay since 2012, until its lack of x265, 4K and Netflix meant we had to look elsewhere in 2017.
Quick side-note: By complete coincidence, XMBC has just been released today on the XBOX One.</description>

      <title>Solved - Missing synced contacts on new iPhone 8</title>

      <description>The parents both got new iPhone 8&amp;rsquo;s for Christmas. I figured it&amp;rsquo;d take 10 minutes to tranfer them from a 5s and a 6 respectively. Boy was I wrong.
Five hours later I finally had them both working ok. Hopefully this post will save you some of my pain with these magical seamless awesome incredible devices (as Tim likes to call them).
 Builtin transfer process - Make sure you have Bluetooth on.</description>

      <title>End of an era - Our Wii is going in the attic</title>

      <description>Last night I setup a monitor in the 12yo&amp;rsquo;s room for his Android media box and his Nintendo Switch. He told me not to bother setting up the Wii. And I was kinda sad.
We became a Nintendo house in 2005 with my US purchase of the original DS for the 6yo. This September he started college. In that time we have bought DS Lites, DSis and 3DSes. And some of them are still in intermittent use from the 18yo down to the 11yo.</description>

      <description>I have a massive backlog of tech posts to do but I never quite finish the projects to the level I want and they are left hanging. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to start posting more WIP stuff from now on and hopefully they&amp;rsquo;ll be useful to someone.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been a long-time fan of the Espruino project created by Gordon Willams and have had great fun with the original board, the Pico and Puck.</description>

      <description>Intro After the silly complexity and Hackaday article! of last year, I decided to keep it simple for Halloween this year. Of course that worked out :-)
The kids&amp;rsquo; favourite thing from all our Halloweens was the doorbell that made scary sounds. So that became the focus. As I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really done anything with my two C.H.I.P.s, I picked one to handle the bulk of the activity. I immediately became a big fan of its small size, built-in Wifi and simple Linux UI.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago, I took my Galaxy S6 out for a run in the rain and it died. Based on previous experience with the horror known as Vodafone Ireland Insurance, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d be looking at 10 days minimum to get a replacement. This proved 100% accurate as the usual completely inept software that connects Vodafone&amp;rsquo;s PDP-11 to Stay Mobile&amp;rsquo;s Commodore 64 had cancelled my insurance without notification several months previously.</description>

      <description>Like my kids, I love regular YouTubers. My particular favourites are the tech, craft, metal and woodworking people who make amazing things every week. Those gals and guys have to be watched to really get the value from them and here&amp;rsquo;s a few more worth looking at too, of course not forgetting these other gems.
But there are others I love equally where it&amp;rsquo;s mostly about what they are saying. For example, Ethan Newberry (aka The Ginger Runner) does a fantastic weekly live session where he mostly interviews Ultra runners.</description>

      <title>Three ways to build Go 1.4 binaries for MIPS32 Onion Omega</title>

      <description>I previously wrote about using gccgo to build Go binaries for the Onion Omega due to Go&amp;rsquo;s lack of support for MIPS CPUs. But TBH it&amp;rsquo;s a pain in the butt. Things were looking up when it was revealed that Go 1.6 would have MIPS support but sadly it&amp;rsquo;s for MIPS64 only, for datacenter applications I guess.
However Cathal Garvey discovered a GitHub repo where some lovely person has ported v1.</description>

      <description> My Car Insurance Broker, 123.ie just offered me up to 10% off my 2016 premium if I installed a driving monitoring app on my phone.
No thanks
But when does it go from &amp;ldquo;get a discount&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;we won&amp;rsquo;t insure you unless you install this app&amp;rdquo;?

      <description>When the incredible $5 Pi Zero was launched, the usual suspects were so busy snarking how it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really $5, that they completely missed what an important moment in computer history this is. You know the type. The ones who would have ridiculed Tim Berners-Lee&amp;rsquo;s design for the web. Or would have told Linus in no uncertain terms that he was misguided and that microkernels were the future.
Whilst you can&amp;rsquo;t turn on a #PiZero for $5, you also can&amp;rsquo;t connect to the LAN with your $1500 Macbook Pro without buying an adapter.</description>

      <description>A completely random braindump of stuff that got my juices flowing this year.
ESP8266 $1 Wifi modules I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about the ESP8266 constantly all year. A price-point of ~$1 in volume means that you can wifi-enable anything. Where previously you might have used one of the many low bandwidth &amp;ldquo;IoT&amp;rdquo; protocols internally and connected them to hub-device, now you can do Wifi and IP end-to-end. The only downside is high power consumption.</description>

      <description>For the third year in a row I decided to build a new oven thermometer for the Christmas turkey, as all of the markings on our temperature knob have been gone for years. We also have one of those mechanical dial thermometers you place inside the oven but they are hard to read and get in the way. My last two attempts worked ok but I was concerned about accuracy.</description>

      <description>Intro I haven&amp;rsquo;t blogged properly about the $5 Raspberry Pi Zero computer yet, despite Tweeting non-stop about it. I will soon. In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;ll just repeat that
It&amp;rsquo;s a major moment in computing
 The inclusion of a free one on the cover of the MagPi Magazine will be remembered for years to come.
The town in which I live, Bandon, flooded again recently, because Ireland. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a simple Node.</description>
